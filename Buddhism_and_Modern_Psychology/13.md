So I've been promising to talk about this thing called the modular view of the mind or the modular model of the mind, and I've suggested that maybe you could answer the big question which is if the conscious self is not the thing that's directing behavior and directing our thought, well then, what is doing that job? And, the answer that comes from the modular view of the mind, is nothing in particular. It doesn't mean nothing. It just means no single thing, is doing the job. Rather, there are a number of these things called modules, and they kind of take turns exerting decisive influence on our thought, our feelings, our behavior. And there's no conscious self kind of picking the module that gets to be in
charge at a given moment.

我承诺过（华佼注：现在完成进行时在强调什么？）要谈论被称为思维模块化的观点，或者思维的模块化模型。我暗示过，也许你可以回答这个大问题，就是如果意识自我不是那个导引行为和我们思想的东西，那么，做那个工作的是什么？答案来自大脑的模块化观点，特别是什么都不是。它不是没有意义。它只是指，不是单个的东西做那个事情。更确切地说，有很多这类东西，被称为模块，它们有点儿轮流执行有决定性的影响，对我们的思想，我们的感觉，我们的行为。没有意识自我，让那个模块，在一个给定的时刻去掌控。

Rather：而是；更确切地说；还不如说；相反

It's more like the modules are seizing control of the system. Here's the way it's been put by Michael Gazzaniga. All these modules are not reporting to a department head, it is a free for all, a self organizing System. And Michael Gazzaniga you may recall is the person who did the split brain experiments that we discussed in the previous lecture. And what he said there does capture the spirit of a lot of thinking about, the modular mind, but I want to emphasize these are early days in the development of these views. about, about modules in the mind. There's no consensus on a single, highly detailed modular model of the mind, and in fact different people may even mean slightly different things when they use the word module. So I want to spend a couple of minutes just looking at different things that the term module can mean by way of clarification. The, the emphasis on modules took shape back at the beginning of what you might call modern evolutionary psychology during the 1980s.

它更像是模块抢占系统控制权。这是Micheal Gazzaniga解释的方式。所有这些模块，不是向一个领导部门汇报，所有模块都是自由的，一个自组织系统。Michael Gazzaniga，你可能回想起来，是那个做裂脑实验的人，我们在先前的课丽江过。他说，它确实抓住了实质，关于许多思考，关于模块化的大脑。但是我想强调，这是这些观点发展的早期。关于大脑的模块的观点。在一个单个，高度详细的模块化的大脑模型上，没有共识，实际上，不同的人甚至在指有点不同的东西，他们在用术语“模型”时。So I want to spend a couple of minutes just looking at different things that the term module can mean by way of clarification. 所以我想花上几分钟时间，只是看看不同的东西，术语“模块”可以表达的意思，通过澄清的方式。对模块的强调，开始于在最初你可能称为现代进化心理学的东西上，在1980年代。

consensus：一致看法;共识
took shape back：？没查到词义
>So I want to spend a couple of minutes just looking at different things that the term module can mean by way of clarification.：
在上次翻译时竟然漏掉了这句话，说明人在疲惫时做事情确实很可能会有遗漏，所以现在对翻译过程进行分解的策略是正确。现在的策略是：第一遍：先直译，不管生词；第二遍，查生词，补充生词部分的翻译，同时查缺补漏；第三遍，待整个课程的全部翻译完成后，再最后润色。前两遍都不用管语句是否通顺，只要自己理解了意思即可。第三遍再加工直译的句子，用其他人容易理解的方式表达出来。

Because there were critics of evolutionary psychology which think why do you need to talk about the role of, of genes in, in shaping The, the human mind, I mean the human mind is just basically a blank slate. Think of it as a general purpose learning machine. It comes into the world with very little in the way of contents, and then it gets filled up through learning, generalized learning processes and then you have a mature brain and you're done. in the evolutionary psychologists said no, no you have to have a lot of specific kind of built in functional mechanisms.

因为对进化心理学有些批评，认为为什么你需要谈论基因的角色，在形成人类思维的过程中。我是指人类思维基本上一个空白。把它看作一个普通目的的学习机器。它来自这个世界，内容非常少，然后它被充满，通过学习，广义的学习过程，然后你有一个成熟的大脑，你完成了。在进化心理学家说，不，你必须有许多具体的内建的功能机制。

slate：石板，行为记录
generalized：普遍的，全面的

And here they got some support from artificial intelligence, because AI had been learning since really the late '50s and '60s how hard it is to design into machines even functions that we kind of take for granted. Mental functions that seem just relatively simple like facial recognition, we don't spend a lot of time puzzling over how we manage to, to recognize people's faces. because it seems to just happen but these people in artificial intelligence had found to get a computer to do something like that, you need to build a lot of highly specialized software. And the evolutionary psychologists said that's the reality of it. As, as, as the brain has evolved over time, a lot of specific equipment has been added by natural selection. And they came to use a metaphor for this, the Swiss Army Knife.

他们从人工智能得到一些支持，因为人工智能一直在学习，从五六十年代，设计成机器，甚至我们当作理所当然的功能，多么难。精神的功能看起来只是简单相关，像面部识别，我们没有花很多时间去解决我们怎么掌握，识别人脸。因为它看起来只是发生，但是这些人，在人工智能，发现，得到一个电脑，做一些事情，想那样的，你需要建立许多高专业化的软件。进化心理学说，那是它的真相。随着大脑随着时间进化，很多具体的设备，被自然选择添加的。它们变得使用一个暗喻为这个，瑞士军刀。

metaphor：隐喻;暗喻;比喻的说法

3:14
The idea was just look, just as a Swiss Army Knife has different blades for different functions The human mind has different modules to perform different tasks, and to that extent, the metaphor is valid, but I think that the metaphor has cons as well as pros, and in fact, I think there are so many ways in which modules aren't like the blades of a Swiss army knife, that, that the way I like to use the metaphor Is, is to drive home the, the senses in which it's misleading. So, I'm going to quickly list three senses in which modules are not like the blades on a Swiss army knife. First of all, if you look at the blades on this knife, each blade occupies a particular part of space.

这观点只是看，只是一个瑞士军刀有不同的刀片，为不同的功能，人类大脑有不同的模块，执行不同的任务。在那个程度上，比喻是有效的。但是我想，这个比喻有利有弊，实际上，我想有许多方法，模块不像瑞士军刀的刀面。所以我将要快速列出三个意义，模块不像瑞士军刀上的刀片。首先，如果你看这个刀上刀片，每个刀片占据了一个部分空间。

con：哄骗;骗；骗局；诡计
pro：赞成；支持
pros and cons：利弊；优缺点

It's very well defined. Whereas, modules are not so localized. It's not like my facial recognition module is like right here and no one, nowhere else. It probably draws on other parts of the brain and in some cases we, we know this for a fact. there's, there's something known as the theory of mind module and this was actually hypothesized a few decades ago. By evolutionary minded physiologists, and the idea is that this is the machinery that let's us infer what people are thinking or feeling based on what they say, how they act, their body language, their expressions. And this idea has picked up a lot of support.

这个被定义的很好。然而，模块不是这样放置的。它不像我的面部识别模块，就在这里，不在任何地方。它很可能利用大脑的其他部分，在有些例子里，我们知道这是一个事实。有些东西，被知道是大脑模块的理论，这实际上是几十年前假设的。被有进化思想的心理学家，这个观点是，这是机制：让我们推测人们在想什么或者感觉什么，基于他们说的话，他们怎样反应，他们的身体语言，他们的表情。这个观点得到了很多支持。

draw on：凭借;利用;动用
hypothesized：假设;假定

In fact it looks increasingly as if, with autism one of the things that is happening is that this theory of mind module is not functioning normally.

实际上它看起来日益增加地，好像，自闭症正在发生的事情之一，是这个理论的大脑模块功能不正常。

autism：自闭症
mind：有时候翻译为思维，有时候译为大脑

4:53
And they're done brain scans of people while they're performing, you know, theory of mind tasks, trying to infer what people are thinking. And it turns out that there is an identifiable part of the brain that is, that seems to get active when people are doing this. But it's no one part. It's, it's a distributed network across the brain. So, so modules are not these localized things. Okay, second sense, In which modules are not like the blades on a Swiss army knife. Is if you look at these blades, they're not interacting with each other, they're not communicating with each other. Whereas modules are going to have to do a certain amount of interaction and communication. So, for example, you know, if you see somebody you know, Well, your knowledge of them is probably going to be fed into the theory of mind module as you try to interpret anything that they now do or say.

他们对正在执行任务的大脑做了扫描，试着推断，人们在想什么。结果发现，大脑有一个可以识别的地方，看起来变得活跃，当人们在做这个时。但是它不是一个部分。它是一个横跨大脑的分布式网络。所以模块，不是那些物理上放置的东西。好吧，第二个意义，模块不像瑞士军刀的刀片，是如果你看这些刀片，他们不是在跟彼此交互，他们不是在跟彼此交流。所以，例如，你知道，如果你看到你认识的某个人。你对他们的了解，将会灌输到大脑模块的理论，当你试着解释任何他们现在做的事情或说的话时。

fed into：馈入，输入

5:49
That means that there has to be some communication however indirect between the facial recognition and the theory of mind module. You know, once you've recognized The person somehow, knowledge about the person has to be fed into the theory of mind module, there's going to be interaction among modules. The third sense in which the blades on a Swiss army knife are not like modules; is if you look at these blades, they're all just tools right? If there's no user, if there's no person who decides how they're going to be used. They just sit there and don't do anything. They don't do anything at all by themselves.

那意味着，有一些交流，然而不直接的，在面部识别和大脑模块理论之间。你知道，一旦你认出了一个人，某种程度上，关于这个人的知识不得不输入大脑模块化理论。将会在模块之间互动。第三个意义，模块不像瑞士军刀的刀片，是如果你看那些刀片，它们都是工具对吗？如果没有用户，如果没有人决定它们怎样被使用，它们只是坐在那里，什么都不做。它们完全不会自己做任何事情。

6:26
And, you know, if you remember what it is we're hoping to get out of, out of the modular view of the mind, this, this isn't enough, you know? I mean surely there are modules like this that are mere tools, but we're going to have to. Find some modules, if this theory is going to deliver what it promises, we're going to have to find some modules that are more than just tools. Modules that, determine how we behave, what we think, what we say, because after all, that's what we now think of the conscious self as now doing. So, if these modules can collectively perform the task we think the conscious self is performing. Then some of the modules going to have to be more than tools. They're going to have to mobilize some of the modules that are tools. You know like the facial, recognition module, right, I mean, as you, as you walk down the street.

你知道，如果你记得它是什么，我们正希望从大脑模块化观点中跳出来，这不够，你知道吗？我是指当然它们是模块，像这个，仅仅是工具，但是我们将要不得不。找一些模块，如果这个理论将要兑现它承诺的东西，我们将要不得不找到一些模块，不只是工具。模块，决定我们怎样行动，我们想什么，我们说什么。因为毕竟，那是我们现在正认为的意识自我。所以，如果这些模块能集中执行任务，我们认为意识自我在执行的任务。那么有些模块将要不得不，不只是工具。它们将要不得不调动有些是工具的模块。你知道，像面部识别模块，对吗，我是指，像你走在大街上。

get out of：解脱
deliver：**履行;兑现;实现**
**mobilize：调动，动用(资源)**

After all there's a number of faces you could, you could look at to see if you recognize them. Well something has to, has to decide which faces you're looking at men, women, old people, young people, who are you going to focus on? And then if you see somebody that you know, how are you going to react to that person? Okay, decisions have to be made. And if they're not being made by the self And the modular theory of the mind is going to explain how they are made. We're going to have to find some modules that are more than mere tools. So that's the question we're going to turn to in the next segment. We're going to start looking at some things that, that, that look like modules and could perform some of the tasks that we think of the conscious self as performing. And if we can find enough of these modules and, kind of, figure out how they work, maybe we'll wind up having no explanatory need for a, kind of, CEO conscious self at all. [BLANK_AUDIO]

毕竟，有很多脸，你能看，如果你识别他们。有些东西不得不决定，你看哪些脸，男人，女人，老人，年轻人，你将要关注谁？然后如果你看你认识的某人，你怎样对那个人反应？好的，必须做决定。如果它们不是被自我决定，大脑的模块化理论将要解释它们是怎么被决定的。我们将要找出某些不仅仅是工具的模块。所以是这个问题，我们将要转向的，在下一节里。我们将要开始看某些东西，看起来像模块，能执行某些任务，我们认为意识自我执行的任务。如果我们能找到足够多的这些模块，有点弄清楚它们怎么工作，也许我们将完全没有解释的必要，对于CEO意识自我。
