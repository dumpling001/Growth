In the last lecture we fleshed out this modular view of the mind, this idea that there's no chief executive in your brain but rather there are a lot of modules that take turns exerting dominant influence on your thought and your behavior and we saw that this view dovetails pretty nicely with this Buddhist idea of not self.

在上一堂课中我们充实了这个思维的模块化的观点，这个观点，是，没有首席执行官，在你的大脑里，而是有很多模块，轮流执行显著的影响你的思想和你的行为，我们看到，这个观点与这个佛教的非我观点契合得很完美。

dovetails：(与…)吻合;(与…)切合

The idea that there is no kind of solid self at your core that persists coherently through time and keeps things under control. There is a pretty close correspondence between this particular model within modern psychology and this particular Buddhist doctrine.

这个观点，没有某种固定的自我在你的内核，在时间上持续连贯，让事情都在控制之下。有一个紧密的联系，在现代心理学里这个特别的模块和特别的佛教教义之间。

correspondence：相似;关联

OK, but what about Buddhist practice? What about meditation? Can the modular view of the mind illuminate meditation and help explain what's going on when people meditate, what's going on in their minds? Well, I do think there are some illuminating connections between the modular view of the mind and meditation and in fact in the last lecture there was buried, a kind of clue about the nature of that illumination.

好吧，但是关于佛教修行呢？关于冥修呢？思维的模块化观点能illuminate冥修，帮助解释当人们冥想时，发生了什么吗？他们大脑里发生了什么？好吧，我确实认为有一些illuminating联系，在大脑的模块化观点和冥想之间，实际上，在上一讲中，有埋一个线索，关于illumination的本质。

It was in something that Linda Cosmidy said, you may remember she's a pioneer in evolutionary psychology and also in developing modular views of the mind. She was talking about a jealous state of mind and describing it as a kind of a modular mechanism that coordinates various thoughts and perceptions to a specific end. She said something and I want to flash back to it here that may give you a clue about this connection between meditation and the modular view of the mind.

它在Linda Cosmidy说的话里面，你可能想起，她是一个先锋，在进化心理学，也在发展大脑的模块化观点。她在谈论关于大脑的妒忌状态，描述它是一种模块化的机制，协调各种思想和知觉，到一个具体的端。她说了一些东西，这里我想要快速回顾下，可能会给你一个线索，关于这个联系，在冥想和大脑的模块化观点之间。

That it's taking over from the point of view of the state that we're usually in where there is not a specific kind of coordination that's going on but a lot of different mechanisms are bubbling up and down in terms of their activation. OK, so she talked about mechanisms bubbling up and down in different levels of activation. Now, I'm hoping that as I repeat that phrase you may be thinking of a phrase that we heard earlier in an earlier lecture.

它在谈论，从状态的观点，我们经常在那里，没有一个具体的协调的种类在进行，但是很多不同的机制在上下冒泡，根据它们的激活情况。她谈论了在不同激活水平下的上下冒泡的机制。现在，我跳过去，当我重复那个短语，你可能想到一个短语，我们在早前的课中听到过的。

I'll pause now and give it a chance to spring to mind. Phrases, default mode network, the default mode network as you may recall is this thing that gets activated when the mind isn't engaged in anything in particular, it's not absorbed in any task. It's kind of just the mind wandering. We also saw that the default mode network gets quieter during meditation. That's what brain scan studies have shown us. If you've done much meditating at all you probably know that sometimes the default mode network doesn't quiet down easily.

我会暂停下，现在，给它一个机会，出现在大脑中。短语，默认模式网络。你可能回想起默认模式网络是这个东西，被激活，特别是当大脑没有参与任何事情时，它不是沉浸到任何任务中。它有点只是思维漫步。我们也看到，默认模式网络变得安静，在冥想期间。那是大脑扫描研究显示给我们看的。如果你做了很多冥想，你很可能知道有时候默认模式网络不那么容易安静下来。

You may sit down to meditate, try to focus on your breath and suddenly you're thinking, "Oh I hope I didn't offend that person yesterday when I said that thing or oh that was an attractive person I met the other day. I wonder if maybe he or she would go to dinner with me. I wonder where we could go. What kind of clever things I could say. What would happen after dinner."

你可能坐下来冥想，试图集中注意力到你的呼吸，突然你在想，“哎呀我希望我没有冒犯那个人，昨天，当我说那些事，或者哎呀，那是个有吸引力的人，我另一天碰见的。我想知道她或他是否可能跟我一起去吃晚饭。我想知道我们能去哪里。我会说那些聪明的话。在晚饭后会发生什么。”

Now, as Linda's phrasing may suggest, somebody who has a modular view of the mind might be inclined to view the default mode network as just a bunch of modules kind of trying to get your attention. I mean, trying metaphorically. Presumably they're not conscious but they're kind of vying, competing for your attention.

现在，像Linda的短语可能暗示的那样，某人有模块化的观点，可能倾向于看默认模式网络作为只是一堆模块，有点儿试着得到你的注意。我是指，metaphorically的尝试。假设它们没有意识，但是它们有点儿vying，为你的注意力竞争。

So when you think, I wonder if I offended that person yesterday, that would presumably be a module in the realm that Douglas Kenrick in the last lecture called the affiliative module. In other words, the larger module in charge of kind of making and keeping friendships and doing various other things and navigating the social landscape. And when you're thinking about having dinner with that attractive person and rehearsing what you might say, then that presumably is part of the mate attraction module.

所以当你想，我想知道我是否冒犯了昨天那个人，将presumably是一个模块，在Douglas Kenrick在上一堂课中称为从属模块的领域。换句话说，更大的模块，掌控着某种结交朋友和维护友谊，和其他各种事情，navigating社交landscape。当你想到和那个有吸引力的人共进晚餐，rehearing你将要说的，然后presumably是配偶吸引模块的部分。

 Now, I want to take this opportunity to qualify something that I said in the previous lecture. There we talked about modules being activated by information out there in the environment. You might be in the presence of someone attractive and that activates your mate attraction module for example but as some of these examples suggests for example thinking, "Oh did I offend that person?" It isn't always the case that information right in your immediate real time environment is what triggers a module. I mean, the information came into your system at some point from the environment but apparently modules can kind of ruminate on information, the information works itself through the process before it actually gets presented to your consciousness in a particular form. Now, this quieting of the default mode network can happen with various kinds of meditation. It can happen with mindfulness meditation and with concentration meditation as we discussed earlier. Concentration meditation is particularly effective at quieting the default mode network in the first instance because if you're focused on something that's a good way to kind of short circuit the default mode network which after all is something that kind of perks up when you're not focused on anything and for that reason in mindfulness meditation you often start with concentration meditation. But at some point in mindfulness meditation, once you've established kind of a concentration in the equilibrium, then you head off in a different path from the concentration meditator and we've talked about that and here you see a particular connection between meditation in modules. They're kind of second connection between meditation and modules that applies specifically to mindfulness meditation. Because remember, mindfulness meditation as we described it, consists of looking at things, things inside your mind and also things in the outside world in a kind of a new way when you might say more objectivity less attachment in carrying that view into everyday life ideally beyond outside of the meditation haul. One of the things that you may view in a new way that is of special consequence is your feelings. As we said, you view your feelings with less attachment and they may not get the same kind of traction with you. They may not have the same kind of power to drag your mind in a particular direction. Well, the other thing we've learned about feelings very recently is that feelings are what trigger modules. If you show people a scary movie it seems to activate a self-protection module by making them feel fear and if you show people a romantic movie it seems to give them feelings that activate a different module and make them behave differently. This is also true with some things we were calling sub-modules in the last lecture. For example jealousy is a very strong feeling that triggers a certain set of modular operations. Now, I would contend that actually there are always feelings associated with modules and that if when you start meditating and these modules are bidding for your attention, if you pay close attention, I think that you'll see that the way they bid for your attention is with feelings. For example, if you're suddenly thinking, "Did I offend that person the other day?" Well, that's a kind of a negative feeling that gets your attention and the way to make it go away, the natural way to make it go away is to come up with a solution to the problem. If you say, "I know what I'll do. I'll send an e-mail to that person ostensibly about something else but in the course of it I'll refer to the conversation we had in a way that will make it clear what I intended and that I didn't intend any offense." Then the bad feeling goes away, the module has done its work and you're now vulnerable to some other module, right? Similarly, if you're fantasizing about that dinner you're going to have with that attractive person, well, that's it. That's a good feeling for the most part and it's a pleasant thing to think about and that keeps you thinking about it. I think that by and large feelings are the things that give modules power over you. So you could view mindfulness, both mindfulness meditation and mindfulness as you carry it out into the world as a way of kind of determining which modules do and don't get to be in control by being mindful of the feelings that usher modules in, that trigger modules. You can influence which modules win and which modules lose. Now, is this a useful way of talking about mindfulness? I mean, after all we've already said something kind of related. We've said earlier in the course that mindfulness does give you some control over feelings. You decide which feelings get traction and which don't and we've said that feelings can change your perceptions. We saw that fear can make you think that something that's not a snake is in fact a snake. Does it do any good to kind of describe this in terms of modules rather than in terms of the feelings that trigger the modules? I think there is some value because I think it drives home that when you're being mindful you're influencing whether an entire frame of mind sets in that influences thoughts and perceptions and that can influence those thoughts and perceptions in really subtle ways and for a really long time. A good example of this I think is hatred. Now, hatred from the point of view of an evolutionary psychologists is among other things a feeling that defines enemies. If you hate someone they are an enemy. You can be angry at someone who is a friend but if you hate them they're not your friend. Natural selection seems to have equipped the human mind to deal in particular ways with enemies and in particular ways with friends. Behavioral scientists have discovered one very interesting feature of the different ways that we look at enemies and friends and it's this. When our friends do something good we attribute it to their inner essence. This is just the kind of thing they do. They're good people. If they do something bad we attribute it to some externals factor, some circumstance. We say, "Oh well it is just peer group pressure or they hadn't had sleep in days so they weren't really themselves." By the way you may recognize this is the way we think about our own behavior, right? When we do something good that's us and when we do something bad there's some external explanation for it. Well, when we think about our enemies it's actually the opposite it turns out. When they do something bad we attribute that to their essential nature. That's the way they are, they're bad. When they do something good we explain it in a way in terms of something external. Well, they were just doing it to please so and so who happened to be there or they were coerced into doing it or whatever. Now presumably this feature exists in our mind, was designed by natural selection presumably to among other things encourage us to talk about enemies in this particular way. When we talk about enemies to other people it's in our interest in kind of strategic terms to talk about them in very unflattering terms because it's in our interest to undermine the stature of our enemies who are people who can do us harm and the more stature they have, the more harm they can do us. This may be very much a propaganda tool but it does seem to be the case that in order to spread the propaganda more effectively we actually believed this. We actually believe that our enemies are these people who do bad things by nature and good things for other reasons. One reason this can be really important is because when a nation is deciding whether or not to go to war, it really matters how the people in the other country and the leader of the country are framed. This helps explain why people who are trying to encourage you to go to war will tend to frame the leader in the country they want to invade as evil as possible. The Iraq war in 2003 was a good example. People who supported the war in America, some of them at least not all of them, compared Saddam Hussein to Hitler who of course is as evil as it gets and if you're going to try to really firmly entrench hatred in someone's mind, that's a good comparison to make. Once you've framed the leader of the nation you hope to invade as an enemy, once you've got that frame firmly set, it's very hard for him to get out of it because if he does anything good or anything accommodating it'll be attributed to external circumstances but whenever he does anything bad it will be taken as more evidence of how bad he is. Now, hatred is a very strong emotion. You know it when you feel it and it's very dramatic but I do think that the kind of frame that it creates, the enemy frame can be sustained with subtler feelings of antipathy. It's not like every time you think of your enemy you fly into a rage. No, it can be a lot subtler than that and that's one reason mindfulness meditation can be valuable and a mindful attitude can be valuable because you pick up on feelings that are sufficiently subtle that you might otherwise miss them. I guess I'd say that in some the case for viewing mindfulness meditation in the context of this modular view of the mind is, first of all it drives home that there's a whole frame kind of being installed in your mind and you can influence which frame it is through mindfulness and that this frame can influence your perceptions very subtly. It's a lot subtler than seeing a snake that's not there and the feelings that sustain the frame can be pretty subtle and in fact you may become aware of them only if you are carrying a mindful attitude into the world. Now, in a way this brings us back to the not self doctrine. We saw earlier that the Buddhist kind of famous discourse on the not self is amenable to differing interpretations. There's the full bodied interpretation that he was emphatically denying the very existence of the self. We saw that there is also a kind of minority interpretation that views his aims as somewhat less ambitious and there the idea is that one way you could look at that discourse as saying, there's no part of your mind that has to be part of yourself. There's no feeling you have to own, there's no thought you have to own and you can choose which things to let go of. Well, to translate that into modular terms, you might say that the idea is there's no module you have to own or there's no module you have to be because remember, modules are these things that are in some sense kind of trying to become the self for a while and that's one reason that Douglas Kenrick in the previous lecture was referring to them as sub cells. As for the deeper notion of not self, the idea that the self really does not exist. There are people who have meditative experiences that convinced them of the truth of this doctrine. They say they have seen the absence of a self kind of in "themselves." I guess I should put that last selves in quotes maybe but they experientially come to know the doctrine of not self. Now, near the end of this lecture we're going to look at whether the modular view of the mind make sense of what's going on in the minds of these people as they have these experiences. We're going to look at some of the kinds of reports you get from these people but first we're going to take a little detour and I think it's going to be a detour that helps us answer this question about what's going on in the minds of these people at least helps us frame it a little more firmly. What we're going to do and this is in the next segment in this lecture, is we're going to look at the issue of self control, of controlling our appetites and we're going to ask, "Well, how does self control happen if in fact there is no self?"
