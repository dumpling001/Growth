At the beginning of this course when I said that I was interested in the question of whether the naturalistic version of Buddhism might qualify as a spiritual or even a religious world view. I, I brought out this William James quote where James said that the animating essence of religion is the belief that there is an unseen order and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves to that order.

在这个课程开始，当我说，我对那个问题有兴趣，即是否，佛教的自然主义版本，可以有资格作为一个精神的，甚至一个宗教的世界观。我提出了这个William James的引用，那里James说，那个宗教活的本质是那个信念，有一个看不见的秩序，我们的至善在于和谐的调整我们自己去适应那个秩序。

brought out：提出，
animating：有生命的，使有生气
supreme good：至善
lies in：在于

And I said kind of tentatively that, it, it would seem that, that Buddhism offers such a thing, you know. It says that the truth about the world is generally unseen. And that if we discover it, and harmoniously align ourselves with the truth, then we will in some sense realize our supreme good. Well, since I said that, you know, I think we've learned a lot more about what the truth is that, that Buddhism asserts.

我说，暂时性的，它将看起来像，佛教提供了这样一个东西，你知道。它说，那个关于世界的真相通常看不到。如果我们发现了它，和谐地根据真相调整自己，那么我们将会在某个意义上实现我们的至善。从我说了那个后，你知道，我想我们学了很多更多关于那个佛教论断的真相是什么。

0:54
So maybe we're in a better position now to ask ourselves whether it really is an unseen order in the sense that James, meant the term. Okay. Whether it really might qualify even a, even a naturalistic Buddhism to be a kind of spiritual or religious worldview. Well, certainly, it's unseen, right? I mean, if, if you take this truth about reality to be the thing that becomes clear when you've obtained enlightenment, well, most people are nowhere near enlightenment And so are no where near seeing this truth.

所以可能我们在一个更好的位置了现在，去问我们自己，是否它真的是一个看不见的秩序，在James用那个词汇指的意义上。好吧。是否，它真的可能有资格，甚至一个自然主义的宗教，是一种精神的或者宗教的世界观。好吧，当然了，它是看不见的，对吗？我是指，如果你把这个关于现实的真相当作那个东西，变得更清晰，当你获得开悟时，好吧，大多数人，不在任何离开悟很近的地方，所以，没有很近的地方看到这个真相。

1:31
But is it an order, okay? Is this truth, does this really qualify as an unseen order? Now that's an important question, because many religions

但是它是一个秩序吗？是这个真相，这个真的有资格成为一个看不见的秩序吗？现在，那是一个重要的问题，因为许多宗教

1:43
they, they assert the existence of an order. In the sense of a kind of divinely imparted plan, say the universe embodies this divinely imparted purpose, this plan. And then you know, the people who are adhering to that religion that, that's where they get the meaning in their lives. Their, their place in the plan is what gives their lives meaning. It's what gives them moral orientation, and it's what inspires a very powerful commitment to this religious world view.

他们断言，秩序的存在。在一种绝妙的传授计划的意义上，说，那个宇宙体现这个绝妙的传授的目的，这个计划。然后你知道，那个人，信奉那个宗教的，那是那里，他们得到他们生活的意义。在那个计划里他们的未知，是给他们生活的意义的东西。它是哥他们道德方向的东西，它是激发一个对这个宗教世界观的非常有力的承诺的东西。

divinely imparted：神性
divinely：天赐的;神的;神圣的；绝妙的;非凡的;极棒的
impart：传授;告知；给予(特定品质)
universe：宇宙
adhering to：信奉

2:18
Well Buddhism, even religious Buddhism, doesn't say that there's an all powerful creator god who, who imparted purpose and a plan to the universe. And certainly this naturalistic Buddhism doesn't say anything about some kind of divinely imparted plan. So the, the question arises you know, can this naturalistic Buddhism assert the existence of, of, of an unseen order

佛教，甚至宗教的佛教，没有说，有一个全能的造物主，传授的目的，和计划，对这个宇宙。当然，这个自然主义的佛教没有说任何事情，关于某种绝妙的传授计划。所以，问题出现了，你知道这个自然主义的佛教可以断言一个看不见的秩序存在吗？

2:43
in, in somewhat the sense that other religions may mean the term and in a sense that does have power. That does inspire commitment. Well I think you know, you can, you can argue that that that is the case. That, that when you look at the, the order that is asserted, it, it, it does have some of that kind of inspiration and, and that kind of potency.

在某个程度上，那个意义，其他宗教可能指那个词语，在某个意义上，那确实有力量。那确实激发了承诺。我想你知道，你能主张，那是那种情况。那，当你看那个秩序，被论断的，它确实有某种那种启发和潜能。

potency：潜能

3:10
Now first of all this unseen order is literally orderly, right? I mean, we, we, we've just seen that that enlightenment, as we imagine it, would, would give you a view of the world with tremendous kind of continuity. There would be more continuity among the different things in the world. And there would be more continuity between you and the world. So, so, where there previously had been fragmentation, you would now apprehend this, tremendous unity. So, this is, this is literally an unseen order.

现在，首先，这个看不见的秩序是有序的，对吗？我是指，我们已经看到了，那个开悟，像我们想象它的那样，将给你一个世界观，有着大量的各种连续性。那将更加连续，在这个世界的不同事物之间。将有更多的连续性，在你和世界之间。所以，先前有碎片的地方，现在你将要理解这个，大量的统一。所以，这是，这是一个看不见的秩序。

literally orderly：有序的
orderly：有秩序的
fragmentation：碎片;片断;小部分

3:50
There is a second and maybe deeper sense in which this, this qualifies as an unseen order.

有第二个，可能更深的意义，在，这个被被授予看不见秩序的东西。


3:58
When we look at that checklist in the previous segment of this lecture you know you had two columns, the truth about the world and moral truth. And the idea was, the path to enlightenment is the path to both. Right. There's an alignment between these two truths, and that brings us to something that we talked about early in this course, right, which is that, that is the Buddhist, assertion. That if you see the world clearly Respond appropriately to it.

当我们看检查清单，在这个课程先前的小节，你知道你有两列，关于世界的真相和道德真相。那个观点是，去开悟的道路，是去两者的道路，对吗。有一个一致性，在这两个真理之间。那带着我们到某个东西，我们在这个课程力之前谈论过的，对的，是，那是佛教徒论断。那个，如果你看世界清楚，反应恰当。

You do align yourself with moral truth. As we saw, this is embodied in the word dharma. Dharma ref, refers to both kind of the natural order and the moral order, and it refers to the teachings about how you should respond to the natural order to the way things are. And responding in that manner, in the prescribed manner, does align you with the moral truth. So, I would say this alignment between the truth about the world, the world, and moral truth, is itself a kind of unseen order at a very deep level.

你确实把自己和道德真相调整得一致。像我们看到的，这是被嵌入到世界dharma里的。Dharma参考两种自然秩序，和道德秩序。它参考教导，关于你应该怎样对自然秩序反应，对事物的方式反应。以那种方式反映，在描述的方式里，确实让你和道德真相一致。所以，我将要说这个，一致，在真相和世界之间的，和道德真相，是它自己，一种看不见的秩序，在一个非常深的层次。

Dharma：（佛教中的）达摩（指佛的教法、佛法、一切事物和现象）；（印度教的）法则；戒条; 被认为是宗教和道德义务的社会风俗 [Hinduism]

5:06
And you know, you, the universe didn't have to, presumably, didn't have to be built this way, right? You can imagine a universe,uh, where learning the truth about the world brings you no closer to the moral truth. Or, or if you respond to the truth about the world in ways that bring you happiness. That doesn't bring you any closer to the moral truth. Or to moral behavior. That the universe didn't have to be built this way. But according to Buddhism, it is, there is this alignment between kind of, the truth about the world, moral truth and you know, your, your fulfillment, the end of your suffering.

你知道，你，宇宙不必，假定，不必构建这个方式，对吗？你能想象一个宇宙，学习关于世界的真相，没有把你带到离道德真相更近的地方。或者，如果你对关于世界的真相反应，以带给你幸福的方式。那不会让你离道德真相更近。或者对于道德的行为。那个宇宙，没有必要构建这方式。但是根据佛教，它是，有这个一致，在关于世界的真相，道德真相，和你知道，你的满足，你痛苦的终结之间。

 So, it's really kind of the trifecta, right? Is built into this universe, and that's kind of a, amazing thing, if true, right? Something something worth marveling at. So I guess I would say that even though Buddhism doesnât talk about an order in the sense of a divinely imparted plan that inspires awe and commitment in virtue of it being Godâs will Nonetheless, there is a kind of order asserted in, in Buddhism that is in its own way awe inspiring. In its, and in its own way does really bring commitment and, and does provide, you know, an, an incentive to be devoted to the prescribed path.

所以，它是真的三重奏，对吗？被内建到这个宇宙，那是一个神奇的事情，如果是真的，对吗？某些东西值得惊叹。所以我才，我将说，即使佛教没有谈论一个秩序，在一个绝妙的传授的意义上，那个激发了敬畏和承诺，凭借它自己。尽管如此，有一种秩序断言在佛教里，那是在它自己的方式使敬畏启发。在它的，它自己的方式，确实真的带来承诺，确实提供，你知道，献身于指定的道路的一个激励。

trifecta： (赛马赌博的)三连赢
marveling at：对...惊奇
awe：敬畏，使敬畏
in virtue of：依靠…，凭借；由于，因为
Nonetheless：尽管如此，但是
incentive：鼓励，激励，刺激，动机
devoted to：献身于
prescribed：规定的，指定的

6:35
Now, there's one other thing that William James said about religions. James said that religions in general tend involve first of all a sense that there is something wrong about us as we naturally stand, an uneasiness. And a sense that we're saved from the wrongness by making proper connection with the higher powers. Well, Buddhism obviously features the first of those, right? The sense that, that there's something wrong, right, duka, you know, suffering, unsatisfactoriness. But what about the, the, the second thing, the sense that, that you can be saved by, by contact with a higher power? well, certainly, especially with the naturalistic form of Buddhism, this wouldn't be contact with any kind of deity. but, I think there is the sense among very serious meditators that sometimes they're making contact with a, a higher form of awareness in a certain sense. A much purer awareness than was previously available. And, that's certainly an interesting scenario, an interesting thing to contemplate. And it suggests a view of our evolutionary history that has almost a mythic quality, okay?

现在，有另外一个东西，William James说的，关于宗教的。James说，宗教，总体来说，倾向包含，首先，有种感觉，有某些东西不对，关于我们，当我们自然地承受一个痛苦时。一个意义，我们从错误中得救，通过做适当的连接，和更高的力量。佛教显然是那些中的第一个重要内容，对吗，那个意义，那个，有什么东西不对，duka，你知道，痛苦，不满足。但是关于第二个事情，怎么样呢，那个意义，你能被挽救，通过与更高的力量接触？好吧，当然，特别是和佛教的自然主义形式，这不会接触，和任何种类的神。但是我认为，有那个意义，在许多严肃的冥想者之间，有时候他们接触一个更高形式的觉知，在某个意义上。一个相当纯粹的觉知，比先前提供的。那当然是一个有趣的情景。一个有趣的事情去沉思。它表明了我们的进化历史有几乎一个神话般的品质，好吗？

all a sense：有种感觉（自己的翻译）
feature：(电影等) 由…主演; (展览会等) 以…为重点；担任主演; 是 (展览、杂志等) 的重要内容
deity：神，神性
mythic：神话的; 虚构的；很著名的; 很重要的

7:54
because, as far as we can tell, consciousness, subjective experience can only be created on this planet, at least, through natural selection, right? But we've also seen that natural selection, in creating consciousness tends to warp it. It, it tends to create these various distortions that we've talked about in, in perception, in cognition and certainly, in moral judgment. And it's interesting to think that maybe natural selection, having created consciousness and warped it in the first place.

因为，至今我们能知，意识，主观的经验，只能在这个星球上被创造。至少，通过自然选择，对吗？但是我们已经看到自然选择，在创造意识，倾向于扭曲它。它倾向于创造这些各种扭曲，我们谈论过的，在感知，知觉，当然了，在道德判断。它很有趣，去想，也许自然选择，有创造意识，第一时间扭曲它。

as far as we can tell：就我们所知
warp：(尤指因受潮、受热而) 翘曲

8:33
Nonetheless eventually gives rise to these kind of self-reflective beings, that would be us, human beings, who figure things out and manage to kind of rid themselves of, of these distortions. Many or even all of these, these distortions you know, they, they kind of manage to, to liberate consciousness in a certain sense from, from the, the, the, the distortions that its, its creator initially imposed on it.

尽管如此，最终还是产生了这些自我反思的生物，那将是我们，人类，人类把事情弄清楚，并试着把自己这些错觉清理出去。许多，甚至所有这些错觉，你知道，他们试着解放意识，在某个意义上，从错觉，它的创造者，最初强加到它上面的。

Nonetheless：尽管如此
gives rise to：产生了
self-reflective：自我反思

9:07
Now of course, you know, again most of us are not going to, going to attain a, a pure form of, of awareness. Presumably that's the kind of thing that, that would be associated with enlightenment. If you ever got there. But, I do think there are very serious meditators who wouldn't make any claim to having been enlightenment, to having been enlightened, who, who nonetheless have had a sense of contact with that kind of purity of awareness, you know, moments. In meditation where you feel you're really in touch with the real truth about things, and that you perception is just no longer kind of distorted by the normal distortion, and I think those experiences those those those moments of seeming contact with the real, the real truth about things.

现在，当然你知道，再次，我们的大多数，将不会获得一个单纯的觉知的形式。假设那是事物，将会与开悟相联系。如果你曾经到过那里。但是我确实认为有许多非常严肃的冥想者，不会发表任何声明说获得了开悟，尽管如此，他们还是有一种与这种意识的纯粹性接触的感觉（翻译参考了youdao），你知道，时刻。在冥想中，你感觉你真的接触到事物的真相，那你觉知只是不再被通常的错觉扭曲，我认为那些经验，那些时刻，看起来与事物的真相相联系的时刻。

nonetheless：但是

10:04
Do inspire commitment to the practice that is some ways comparable in its power to the commitment that is inspired in other religions by kind of their version of, of of, of a connection with higher powers. So this is naturalistic version of Buddhism a religious worldview, is it a spiritual worldview? I'll let you make the call.

启发承诺修行，是某种方式兼容，在它的力量，去承诺，被启发，在其他宗教里，被他们的与更高力量链接的版本。所以这是佛教自然主义版本，一个宗教的世界观，它是一个精神的世界观吗？我将让你做决定。

make the call：做主，做出诊断

10:32
I would say that if you look at the way William James framed the thing it does ar, arguably qualify. You know, there is the, the, the belief that there's an unseen order and a fairly profound sense in that, in that yes, our supreme good lies in adjusting ourselves to the order. Also that yes, there is a sense that there's something fundamentally wrong in the human condition, something fundamentally awry And that the remedy lies in, a connection with, in some sense, a higher power. Not a higher power, in the sense of a deity, but a higher form of awareness that is itself, very powerful. So, I would say, you know, as a naturalistic kind of substitutes for religion go this one is, you know, not bad.

我将说，如果你看William James构建事物的方式，它确实可以说有资格的。你知道，有，那个信仰，有一个看不见的秩序，一个相当深刻的感觉，在那个，是的，我们的至善依赖调整我们自己适应那个秩序。也是，有一个意义，有某些东西根本地错误，在人类的条件下，某个东西根本错误，那个解决方法依赖于，在一个联系，在某个意义上，和更高的力量。不是一个更高的力量，在神意义上，但是一个更好觉知的形式，那是它自己，非常有力量。所以，我将说，你知道，作为一个自然主义的替代品，对于宗教，这一种，你知道，不坏。

arguably：可以说；可论证地；可争辩地；正如可提出证据加以证明的那样地
fundamentally：根本地，从根本上（讲）
fundamentally awry：根本错误
awry：出岔子的;出错的；歪的；斜的
remedy： (问题的)解决方法，解决良方；药品;治疗方法

11:21
I'd also say that even if you're not looking for a substitute, you know, even if you've already got your own religion in a traditional sense This the, you know, this kind of naturalistic Buddhism probably also works as a kind of a supplement, right. I mean the practice of meditation and the basic philosophy that we've seen accompanying it I think is compatible with various religious traditions.

我将也要说，即使你没有找一个替代品，你知道即使你已经得到你自己的宗教，在一个传统的意义上，你真屌，这个自然主义的佛教很可能也起作用，作为一种补充。对吗。我是指，冥想的联系，和基本的这些，我们看到随着它我想，是兼容的，和各种宗教传统。

11:50
And I would, I would even say that there's a kind of a synergy between it and, and the major religious traditions. I think all of these traditions have kind of themes and precepts that really resonate with the world view we've been describing.

我将，我将甚至说，在它和主要宗教传统之间有一种协同作用。我认为所有这些传统都有主题和准则，真的与我们一直描述的这个世界观有共鸣。

synergy：协同作用
resonate：共振；(对某人) 有重要性
precepts：准则

12:08
I mean, my own upbringing was in the Christian tradition, and so, you know, I think of, for example, Jesus saying, basically, you know, why are you so focused on this, this speck in the eye of this other guy when you've got, you know, a, like a log lodged in your own eye. In other words, the idea is that, you know here you are obsessing over this, this minor perceptual distortion that other people may have when you've got a pretty major one yourself.

我是指，我自己的教养是在基督教传统下。所以你知道，我认为，例如基督说，基本上你知道，为什么你要如此专注于这个，这个污点，另一个人的眼睛，当你得到，你知道，像一个木材，卡住在你自己的眼中。换句话说，观点是那个，你知道这里，你过度迷恋这个，这个小的知觉的扭曲，其他人可能有的，当你自己有一个相当主要的一个。

upbringing：教养
speck：污点; 斑迹
log：木柴; 原木
lodged：卡住

That's obviously a very consistent with kind of this, this world view, we've been describing and I know that all the major religions, you know, have these kind of thematic synergies with this world view. Anyway, whatever you want to call this world view we've been talking about over these last six weeks. You know, this meditative path, informed by Buddhist philosophy. Whether you want to say yes, it's a religion, or no, I don't think it qualifies as a religion, but it's a spiritual world view. Or you just want to say it's a therapeutic perspective. Or whatever.

那显然，是一个非常一致的，和这个世界观，我们一直在描述的，我知道，所有主要的宗教，你知道，有这种主题的协同作用和这个世界观。无论如何，你想要称这个世界观什么，我们一直在谈论的，在过去6周里。你知道，这个冥想道路，被佛教徒的哲学告诉我们的。你是否想要说，是的，它是一个宗教，或者，不，我不认为它有宗教的资格，但是它是一个精神的世界观。或者你只是想说它是一个有益健康的角度，或者什么。

thematic：主题的; 专题的
therapeutic：(尤指不开心的情况下) 使人放松心情的；治疗的；治疗学的；有益于健康的
inform：告知；检举；弥漫 (思想或品质等)

13:14
I would say the following.

我将要说下面的话。

13:17
If you look at the human condition from the standpoint of modern psychology, and in particular, evolutionary psychology. And you look at the way our evolutionary history has afflicted us with perceptual distortions and moral biases, and dissatisfaction, and out and out suffering, and you ask well is there a world view that address this problem? Well there are a lot of world views, and, and many of them do it effectively. There are religions, there are therapeutic traditions, but, I am not personally aware of a naturalistic world view that addresses the problem as straightforwardly, and as honestly, and as unflinchingly, as the one we've been talking about.

如果你看人类条件，从现代心理学的角度，特别是，进化心理学。你看我们进化历史的方式，有折磨我们，带着知觉扭曲和道德偏见，和不满足，和痛苦，你问，这是一个强调这个问题的世界观吗？有很多世界观，他们中的许多做得很有效。有宗教，有治疗的传统，但是我个人没有觉察到一个自然主义的世界观，强调那个问题，像我们一直谈论的那样直白，诚实，和毫不动摇地。

afflicted：折磨
unflinchingly：不妥协地；不畏缩地；不畏缩的，坚定的，果敢的

Now, I, personally, am going to keep exploring this worldview for some time to come in one sense or another. Maybe some of you will too. But whether or not you do that. I want to thank you for sharing in my exploration of it. I've gotten a tremendous amount out of teaching this course, out of preparing the material for presentation. But also, more importantly out of the online interaction with students, and, and you know, getting the feedback about the ideas And the way I presented them and I can honestly say that as a result of all that, I am now seeing things more clearly than I was before, so thank you for that.

现在，我个人，将要继续探索这个世界观，用一些时间，去在一个意义上，或者另一个。可能你们中某些人也会。但是无论你是否那样做，我想要感谢你，在我的探索里共享了这一段。我从教授这门课里，从准备演讲的材料里，但是也，更重要的，从与学生们的在线互动中，你知道，得到反馈，关于那些观点，我呈现它们的方式，从这些里面，我得到了大量的东西。我能诚实地说，结果，我现在看东西比之前更加清楚。所以我因为那个感谢你。

out of：从...中，由于，缺乏
