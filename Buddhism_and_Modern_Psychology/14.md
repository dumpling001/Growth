So in the previous segment of this lecture we talked about mental modules. I said they're different kinds of modules, and I said that there's a particular kind of module that we're looking for. We're looking for modules that aren't just tools, like the blades in a Swiss Army Knife, but are in a sense command modules. That is they can, they can take control of the mind for at least a while. Because if there are such modules, that would help explain how the mind could operate effectively without there being a single unified self in control. The idea is that there might be a number of these command modules and they would kind of take turns running the show. Well, I've got good news. I have found such modules, or at least I've found somebody who says that he has found such modules. His name is Douglas Kenrick. He's a psychologist at Arizona State University and in 2013 he co-authored a book called, The Rational Animal, which puts forth a modular view of the mind, a modular model. And the book argues that when it comes to our social behavior, we're pretty much always under the influence.


在本堂课上一小节我们谈论了精神模块。我说它们是不同类型的模块，我说有一个特别的模块，我们正在找。我们在找不仅仅是工具的模块，像瑞士军刀上的刀片，但在某个意义上是命令模块。就是它们能控制大脑至少一小会儿。因为如果有这种模块，那将帮助解释，大脑如何有效运作，在没有有控制力的单个统一的自我的情况下。观点是，这里可能有很多控制模块，它们将会轮流主持节目。好吧，我有好消息，我找到了这些模块，至少我发现有人说，他发现了这样的模块。他的名字是Douglas Kenrick。他是一个心理学家，在Arizona州立大学，在2013年，他合著了一本书叫做，理性动物。那本书提出一个大脑的模块化观点，一个模块化模型。这本书主张，当谈及到我们的社交行为，我们相当总是在影响之下。

put forth: 提出（计划或建议）

1:05
Of one of seven modules that, Kendrick and his co-author call sub-selves. Now, sub self is an interesting term. The prefix, sub, of course, means under. So this might suggest that there is one unified self at the top. Of the hierarchy. And it determines which of the seven modules or **subselves** is in charge at any given time. It delegates authority. Well, it turns out that, actually, that's not what Kenrick meant to convey by the term as became evident in an exchange I had with him recently.

在七个模块之一，Kendrick和他的合著者称为子自我.现在子自我是一个有趣的术语。前缀，sub，当然，意思是在什么之下。所以这可能暗示，有一个统一的自我在上面。在层级结构的上面。它决定了，七个模块的拿一个，或者子自我在任何给定的时间里起控制作用。它代表权威。好吧，结果是，实际上，它不是Kenrick意图传递的，通过这个术语传递的，as变得明显，在一次我跟他最近的交流中。

delegates：代表，授权，委派（做）

·>> With these sub cells or modules, I might view these sub cells as almost kind of mega modules or mega modules because they mobilize a lot of smaller modules.

这些子单元或者模块，我可以把这些自自我看作几乎是超级模块，或者超级模块，因为它们调动了很多更小的模块。

mega：超级

·>> They're higher level modules, but I'd say that's as high as it gets. There isn't another one at the top. There isn't another kind of decision, there isn't like a president in charge of all this.

它们是高层次的模块，但是我要说，它已经到了最高点。在上面没有其他模块。没有另一种类型的决定，没有像总统一样掌控全部的东西。

·>> Right.

对的。

·>> All there are, are there's you know, a Secretary of State and a Secretary of Warfare and you know.

有，你知道，国务卿，和战争大臣，你知道。

Secretary of State：国务卿

·>> Right.

对的。

·>> And then a Secretary of you know, Mayday.

然后，一个秘书，你知道的，五月号？？

·>> Okay, so Kenrick says these modules are like cabinet secretaries. That raises at least three questions. First of all, what are the seven cabinet positions? What domains. Are these modules in charge of. Second, what determines, if there is no president, what determines which module is in charge at a given time and third what difference does it make which module is in charge? What exactly are the changes in behavioral and mental disposition that different modules. Usher in. Well as far as the question goes, you know, what are the seven Cabinet positions. Kenrick is an evolutionary

好的，所以Kenrick说，这些模块像内阁秘书。这引发了至少三个问题。首先，七个内阁位置是什么？什么区域？这些模块主控吗？第二，什么决定，如果没有总统，什么决定了哪个模块掌控，在某个时间点上。第三，哪个模块掌控有什么差别？确切的是在行为和精神上的倾向，不同模块的改变引入的。**不同模块在行为和心理倾向上的变化究竟是什么？** 至今问题继续，你知道，什么是七个cabinet位置。Kenrick是一个进化心理学家，

cabinet：内阁
disposition：倾向，意向
usher in：开启；迎来；引入

psychologist, so he approaches his question from an evolutionary point of view. And he says, well basically in the realm of social behavior, there are seven main kinds of challenges in his view. That our ancestors had to meet in order to get their genes into the next generation. So you would expect natural selection to build a mind that attends to these seven areas of challenge. And that's how he comes up with his list of seven modules. First, there's a self protection module, which, indeed, would be a valuable thing from natural selection's point of view. In other words. The ability to fend off harm if other members of our species want to harm us.

所以他处理他的问题，从一个进化的观点。所以他说，基本上，在社交行为的领域，在他的观点里有七种主要类型的挑战。我们的祖先必须见面，为了让他们的基因传到下一代。所以你将期待自然选择建立一个大脑，倾向于这七个挑战区域的大脑。那是他怎样提出他的七模型列表的。首先，这是自我保护模块，实际上，从自然选择的观点看将是一个有价值的东西。换句话说，抵御伤害的能力，如果我们种群的其他成员想要伤害我们。

approaches：处理
realm：领域
fend off：抵御

3:28
second, if the object of the game is get genes into the next generation, it would help to be able to attract mates. It would also help to be able to hold onto mates, and then there is what Kenrick and his coauthor called the affiliation. Module that has to do with making friendships and making alliances and so on. There's the kin care module, in other words taking care of other people who share a lot of your genes. That makes sense in terms of. Natural selection. There's a status module. Certainly people do seem inclined to seek status and to display status. And that does seem to be correlated with getting genes into the next generation during evolution. And then there's a kind of anomalous module.

第二，如果游戏的目的是让基因传到下一代，它将帮助能够吸引配偶。它也帮助能保住配偶，然后有Kenrick和他的合著者称为从属关系的东西。模块，与结交朋友和建立联盟等等相关。根据自然选择它说得通。有一个状态模块。当然人们确实看起来倾向于谋取地位并展示地位。在进化过程中，那确实看起来与“把基因传递到下一代”相关。然后有一种反常的模块。

hold onto：保住
affiliation：从属关系
alliances：联盟
anomalous：反常的

4:15
The disease avoidance module which just means, you know, basically staying away from people who seem to carry germs. Now, I want to emphasize, this is just one possible module or view of the mind. It's not a consensus view among people who take a module or view of the mind. But it does make sense as a basic division of mental labor and it certainly gives us something to get a handle on in terms of just thinking about these modular models of the mind. Now we can look at specific proposed modules, ask how

疾病避免模块，只是指，你知道，基本远离看起来携带病菌的人们。现在，我想要强调，这只是一个可能的模块，或者对思维的看法。它不是那些有思维模块化观点的人们看法一致的观点（华佼注：我认为应该没有“or”）。但是它确实说得通，作为一个基本的精神劳动的分类，它当然给我们一些东西，去控制，根据只是思考这些思维模块化的模块。现在我们能看具体的被提出的模块，

germs：病菌
labor：劳动
proposed：被提出的

they would work and see how valuable this kind of model actually is. So let's focus on the first two modules, self protection and mate attraction, and let's ask the second and third of those three questions I just outlined, okay. Second question is what is it that determines which module will be in charge at any given time. And here I think Kenrick's answer is pretty much the answer that you'd get from a lot of people who subscribe to a modular view of the mind. The basic idea is, that which ever module is most highly activated by information in the environment, will tend to become dominant for some period of time. So one example is.

问它们将怎样工作，看这种模型实际上怎样有价值。所以让我们关注前面两个模块，自我保护，和配偶吸引。让我们问我刚刚列出的那三个问题中的第二个，第三个。第二个问题是，它是什么，决定，哪个模块将在某个给定的时间主控。我想Kenrick的答案刚好就是那个答案，就是你将从许多人那里得到的，那些人赞成大脑的模块化观点。**基本的观点是，总是那个模块，最高度地被环境中的信息激活的模块，将倾向于变得地位显著，对那个特定的时间段。** （华佼注：完全同意这个观点。我的一种模糊的直觉在这里被表述的非常清楚。张小龙在饭否上也曾经表述过同样的观点：人是环境的产物。）这是一个例子。

subscribe to：同意；赞成；订购
ever：就会…;总是…

5:33
If somebody is running toward you waving a machete saying I'm going to kill you, then that would, you know, the self protection module would kick in and you might start running away and screaming help, help help. That's a pretty straight forward example of a module becoming highly active and then dominate and kind of controlling your behavior. In fact, it's such a straightforward example that you might ask, wait a second, do we really need all this fancy module talk? I mean I've, I've always known that fear makes people do things like run away. How much value is really added when we, when we call this thing a module? Well, it's a good question, but I would ask you, just reserve judgement and see how far we can go with these, with this model and see what it looks like after we flesh it out.

如果某人朝你跑过来，你挥着一个大砍刀说，我要杀了你，然后那将，你知道，自我保护模块将会起作用，你可能开始逃跑，喊叫救命，救命，救命。那是模块的一个相当直接的例子，变得高度活跃，然后主导，有点儿控制你的行为。实际上，它是如此直白的一个例子，你可能会问，等一下，我们真的需要所有这些花哨的模块说吗？我是指，我一直知道，恐惧让人们做像逃跑那样的事。多少价值真的被增加了，当我们，当我们称这些东西是一个模块？好吧，这是个好问题。但是我将要请你，只是保留判断，看看我们能走多远，带着这个模块，**看看我们能用这个模型走多远** 看看它看起来像什么，在我们充实它之后。

machete：大砍刀
kick in：开始生效，起作用
fancy：花哨的
reserve：保留

A little more. For now, let's move onto the third of the three questions. What difference does it make which module is in charge? How does a module change our behavioral and mental disposition? And here I think what's interesting is how subtle some of the changes can be. And this came through in an experiment that Kenrick did along with a number of. Collaborators one thing they were looking at in this experiment. Is how do people respond to advertising. They created an ad for a meuseum. And they created two different versions of the ad with two different tag lines. One of the tag lines was visited by over a million people each year.

再多一点。对于现在，让我们移到三个问题中的第三个。它有什么区别，哪个模块主控？一个模块怎么改变我们的行为和精神的倾向？我想有趣的是，有些改变可以是怎样的微妙。这个来自与一个实验，Kenrick做的，并伴随着许多合作者。一件事他们观察的，在这个实验里。是人们怎样对广告做反应。他们创造了一个博物馆的广告，他们创造了两个带着不同口号的不同版本的广告。**他们用两个不同的口号制作了两个不同版本的广告。** 口号中的一个，被访问，被一百万以上的人们，每年。

disposition：倾向
tag line： (广告的)口号，主题句;（笑话末尾的）妙语，包袱

And the other tag line was, stand out from the crowd. Now those are two very different angles that you would think might appeal to different kinds of people. But one question that Kenrick and his collaborators, and his collaborators were interested in was, well, could you change which ad pitch will appeal to a given person by changing which module is in charge at that moment. So they came up with a way of activating either the self protection module or the mate attraction module. They showed people scenes from one of two movies, either a scary movie, The Shining with Jack Nicholson or a romantic movie called Before Sunrise.

另一个口号是，从人群中脱颖而出。现在那些是两个非常不同的角度，你将认为可能吸引到两种不同类型的人。但是一个问题Kenrick和他的合作者们，他的合作者们，感兴趣的是，好吧，你能改变，哪个广告推销将会吸引到一个特定的人，通过改变当时正在主控的模块吗？所以他们提出一个方法，激活或者自我保护模块，或者配偶吸引模块。他们给人们展示景色，从两个电影中的一个，或者是恐怖电影，Jack Nicholson演的《闪灵》或者一个爱情电影，叫《爱在黎明破晓前》。

stand out：脱颖而出
pitch：为…作宣传；替…说好话
The Shining with Jack Nicholson：Jack Nicholson演的《闪灵》

7:37
Then after the people had seen parts of one of these two movies, then they saw the ad. And then they were asked questions like, well how inclined would you be to visit this museum? And it turned out that people who had seen the scary movie, were more inclined to visit the museum when they saw the tag line, visited by over a million people each year. Perhaps because you know, there is safety in numbers so if your fear module is activated, if Jack Nichols is chasing you with an ax, you'd rather be around a lot of people who might be able to help. But in an event, that was the finding. And it turned out that seeing the romantic movie inclined people to go for the tagline stand out from the crowd, which could be because when we're in courtship mode, we're trying to distinguish ourselves from other people.

在人们看到了这两个电影中一个的部分之后，然后他们看那个广告。然后他们被问问题，像你将有多有倾向去参观这个博物馆？结果发现看过恐怖电影的人，更愿意去参观，当他们看到口号，每年有超过一百万人参观的。也许因为你知道，在数字里有安全感。所以如果你害怕模块被激活，如果Jack Nichols在追逐你，带着一个斧头，你将宁愿在很多可能会帮助你的人们中间。但是在一个情况下，那是发现。结果发现，看浪漫电影的人，让人们倾向于去一个口号是从人群中脱颖而出，那可能是因为，当我们在求偶模式时，我们试着让我们与其他人区分开来。

Could also be because when we're in courtship mode, in mate attraction mode, we are looking for an intimate environment to be alone with the person. But in any event, what's interesting here is that here's something that you might think is a more or less fixed part of a person's personality. In other words, they're going to go for one tag line or the other. There's two kinds of people. And I imagine that's the way advertisers might think of it, that these two ads would appeal to two different kinds of people. But no, it turns out that actually it, each, each ad can appeal to one person it just depends on which you, you are at the moment. It depends on which module is in charge at the moment.

也可能因为当我们在求偶模式时，在配偶吸引模式，我们在找一个亲密的环境，和那个人在一起。但是在任何情况下，有趣的是，有些东西你可能认为是或多或少是一个人个性的固定部分。换句话说，他们将去，因为一个口号或者另一个。有两种人。我想象，那是广告商可能认为的那样，这两个广告将要吸引到两种不同类型的人。但是，不，结果发现，实际上，每个广告能吸引到同一个人，只是取悦于那个时刻是哪个你。它取悦于那个时刻哪个模块是主控的。

9:12
Now there was another experiment that, that looked at a very similar idea. In other words, it looked at something we might expect to remain pretty constant and then, and then it examined how you might actually make it, make it change.

现在有另一个实验，看一个相似的观点。换句话说，它看有些东西我们可能期望去保留相当常量，然后它检查你实际上可能怎样让它改变的。

9:28
And this is this involves something that economists call a time discounting rate or future discounting rate or in even more technical terms. An inter-temporal utility function. What this refers to is your willingness to forgo reward in a short term for a greater reward in the future. So if I say to you, look, you can either have $10 today or you can have $15 in a month, which do you want? How you answer this question, and other questions like that, determines what your time discount rate is. And economists have long said that, you know, people will, different people have different such rates.

这是这个，包括了有些东西，被经济学家称为一个时间贴现率，或者将来贴现率，或者甚至更多技术术语。一种跨时间的效用函数。这个指的是，你的意愿，去放弃奖励，在短期，为一个更大的奖励，在将来的。所以如果我对你说，看，你能或者有10美元今天，或者你能有15美元一个月以后，你要哪种？你怎么回答这个问题，和另一个像这样的问题，决定了你的时间贴现率是什么。经济学家一直说，你知道，人们，不同的人们有不同的这种比率。

An inter-temporal utility function. 一种跨时间的效用函数
discounting：贴现
forgo：放弃

But the models of economists have tended to assume that any given person's time discount rate would remain a constant. You know, from day to day and week to week. Well, it turns out not to be the case, and one way we know is because of an experiment that was done by Margo Wilson who was a very important figure in evolutionary psychology and passed away a few years ago. And she did the experiment along with her long time collaborator Martin Daly. And what they did is, they took men and they showed some of them pictures of women who had been judged as attractive on one of these websites where people go and judge men and women as either hot or not hot.

但是经济学家的模型，倾向于假设，任何特定的人的时间贴现率将保持为一个常量。你知道，一天有一天，一周又一周。好吧，结果发现不是那样的。我们知道的一个方法是，因为一个实验，被Margo Wilson做的，他是一个非常重要的人物，在进化心理学上，几年前去世了。她做了这个实验，和她的长期合作者Martin Daly。他们做的是，他们选择男人们，他们给这些男人们的一些人显示女人的图片，那个女人被认为是有吸引力的，在这些网站上，人们去判断男人和女人，是性感还是不性感。

10:53
And they showed other men pictures of other things, either women who hadn't been judged as attractive or pictures of men or pictures of cars. Or whatever. And it turned out that, when men had seen these pictures of attractive women, they were then more inclined than they otherwise would have been to, want their money now. To not be willing to forego immediate, reward for a greater reward in the future. And the, kind of, common-sensical evolutionary explanation of this is that, you know, when the mate attraction module is activated, when you're in courtship mode, you want to put on a display, you want to have all your resources there to show off in front of the woman.

他们显示其他男人的图片，在其他东西中。或者没有被判定为有吸引力的女人，或者男人的图片，或者车的图片。或者其他什么。结果发现，当男人看过了这些有吸引力的女人图片后，他们就更倾向于比他们原本更想要他们的钱了现在。不愿意放弃立刻，奖励为更大的奖励在将来的。对这个有点基本感觉进化的解释是，你知道，当配偶吸引模式被激活时，当你在求偶模式，你想要表现，你想要有你那里所有的资源，去在女人面前炫耀。

put on：（行为举止）做作，矫饰，刻意表现

11:37
Now this you know, if this is the strategy it doesn't seem to be orchestrated at a conscious level because remember they're just looking at pictures of attractive women. And, and there's no way they'd think consciously I'd certainly like to impress this picture of a woman whom I will never actually meet.

现在你知道，如果这是策略，它看起来不是精心策划的，在一个有意识的层次上。因为记住，他们只是看了有吸引力的女人的照片。他们可能有意识的想，我当然想要给照片上那个我实际绝不会遇到的女人留下印象。

orchestrated：精心策划

11:55
That doesn't make any sense, right?

那说不通，对吗？

11:58
And the fact that the mere picture of a woman does trigger this kind of strategic response reminds us that we were designed by natural selection for an environment that's different from the current environment. In other words, it was an environment in this case. Before the invention of photography.

那个事实，单纯的女人的图片，触发了这种策略性的反应，提醒了我们，我们被自然选择设计，为一个环境，不同于当前的环境。换句话说，它是一个环境，在这个情况里。在摄影被发明之前。

So during evolution if you ever saw a, an, an image of a woman, there was a real woman there. So our, our, our minds are designed to, in some ways at least respond to images of, all images of women as if they were real women. Now there was another experiment Where a feature that you might think is a pretty more or less constant property of a person's mind turned out to change in response to the activation of the mate attraction module.

在进化中，如果你曾经看过一个女人的图片，有真的女人的那里。所以我们的意识，被设计来，在某种程度上，至少是对所有女人的图片的反应，好像她们是真的女人。现在有另一个实验，特点，你可能认为的，是相当，多多少少常量的属性，一个人的思想，表现得，改变，对配偶吸引模式的激活的反应。

In this experiment psychologists took high school males. And they had them fill out a survey about their career aspirations. Some of them filled it out in a room full of other males. Some of them filled it out in a room that included both males filling it out and some females filling it out. And it turned out that the, the boys in the room that included girls their age were more inclined to have more ambitious career aspirs, aspirations and in particular to, to rate income, making a lot of money as an important goal associated with their aspirations.

在这个实验里心理学家，选取了高中男生。他们让男生们填了一个调查，关于他们的职业愿景。他们中的一些，在一个都是男人的房间里填了；其他一些在一个有男有女的房间里填表。结果发现，在有女生的房间里填表的男生，他们的年龄更倾向于有野心的职业抱负，特别是，把收入、赚很多钱当作一个重要的目标，跟他们的野心相关。

aspirations：抱负；志向；渴望

Now, I doubt that this was some kind of enduring change in their actual aspirations. It could well be that what was happening was that their minds were being prepared for a kind of self advertisement, a kind of display. In other words, in the event that they wound up talking to the females in the room, they would be all prepared to talk about how they were going to conquer the world and make lots of. Money and so on. But if that indeed was the strategy, it, it, it, doesn't seem to have been a conscious strategy, because after all, the surveys they were filling out, the girls weren't going to see, and the girls couldn't see the surveys from where they were.

现在我怀疑，这是某种持久的改变，在他们实际的愿望。它可以是，发生的什么，他们的思想准备着，为一种自我广告，一种展示。换句话说，在那些情况下，他们最终跟房间里的女性们谈话，他们将都准备好谈论他们怎么将要征服世界，赚很多的钱，等等。但是如果那个实际上是一种策略，它看起来不是一个有意识的策略，因为毕竟，他们正在填写的调查，女生也不会看到，女生们不能看到他们在填写的调查表。

enduring：持久的
wound up：最终

14:05
And moreover, these, these the people in the experiment had been told not to talk to one another, so there wasn't even a prospect **of talking** to the girls in the short run. So again this is a case where this doesn't seem to involve conscious orchestration of a kind of strategy. There's no conscious decision to usher in a particular module and yet it happens nonetheless. By the way, in both of these last two experiments, the experiments were performed not only on males, but also on females.

更重要的是，这些人，在实验中的，被告知，不要相互谈论，所以这儿在短期内甚至没有跟女生们说话的可能。所以再次，这是一个例子，这看起来不是包括了一种有意识策略的精心策划。没有有意识的决定，去开启一个特别的模式，然而它发生了，虽然如此。顺便说下，在最后两个实验里，不仅对男生做了实验，还对女生做了实验。

a prospect of：可能，前景
orchestration：精心策划，非源自词典，自译。
usher in：开启；迎来；引入
nonetheless：虽然如此，但是

But the, the effecting question was not found in the case of the females, and that's in keeping with the view in evolutionary psychology that when it comes to, kind of, romantic psychology, sexual psychology. There will be some differences between, between men and women. You could have just as easily done experiments that would highlight distinctively female features of the mate a, attraction module. Just so happened that these. Focused on male features.

但是有效的问题，没有在这些女生那里找到。那与进化心理学的观点一致：当谈及某种浪漫心理学时，性心理学，在男女之间有一些差异。你可以只是简单的做实验，实验会显著强调吸引男性模块的女性特征，Just so happened that these？？？关注于男性特征。

Just so happened：碰巧

Okay, so we've seen three things that you might think would be more or less constant features of a person's personality and wouldn't, wouldn't change a lot. What kind of ad pitch they respond to, what their career aspirations are, and what their timed discounting rate is. In all three cases, there can be significant change in these. Without some kind of conscious self deciding to make the change.

好吧，所以我们看到了三件事，你可能认为是或多或少常量特种，一个人的个性，不会改变很多。他们对什么广告宣传有反应，他们的职业抱负是什么，他们的时间贴现率是什么。在所有三个例子里，可能有一个重要的改变。没有某种意识自我决定，去做这个改变。

pitch：为…作宣传；替…说好话

15:38
Now, you might look at this and say, you, you still might ask the question, do we really need all this module talk? Can't we talk about these people just being in say, a romantic mood? Well, I don't think so. I mean I, I, I doubt that the, the people who were taking the survey, the guys who were taking the survey in the presence of the girls were really entering what we normally call a romantic mood and I doubt that was true of the guys who were shown the pictures of. The women. I am of the view that there is probably some change in affect, some change in feeling that is associated with these shifts of module, but I don't think the, the word mood is going to always be appropriate.

现在，你可能看这个，说，你仍可能问，我们真的需要所有这些模块说吗？我们不能谈论这些人，只是说，在一个浪漫的情绪里吗？好吧，我不认为是这样。我是指，我怀疑，人们，做调查的人们，正在接受调查的人们，在有女生在场时，真的进入了我们通常称为浪漫情绪；我怀疑对那些被展示女性图片的男生们来说那是真的。我的观点是，很有可能，有些改变，在影响某些改变，在改变与这些模块移动相关的感觉，但是我不认为，情绪这个词将总是合适的。

affect：影响

Another reason that I think the term module makes sense. Is because, you know, we're talking when you add it all up, we're talking about a-a-a kind of diverse array of changes in our very mental orientation, our frame of mind. And that includes our, our perceptual framework because if you remember from the first lecture, we talked about an experiment. In which first psychologists showed people a part of a scary movie, in this case it was Silence Of The Lambs. And then they showed them pictures of males in a different ethnic group, and these were facial expressions that had been judged as neutral.

另一个原因，我认为术语模块说得通，是因为，你知道，我们在谈论，当你把它全部加起来，我们在谈论变化的diverse阵列，在我们的非常非常精神导向上，我们大脑的框架。那包括我们的知觉框架，因为如果你记得，从第一堂课开始，我们谈论的一个实验。在第一个心理学家给人们展示恐怖电影，在那个例子里，它是《沉默的羔羊》。然后他们展示一些另一些种族男性的图片，这些是被判定为中性的面部表情。

By objective observers but the people who'd seen the scary movie judged the, the faces to be threatening and angrier. So, so our very kind of perceptual field is, is changed when, when modules change. Now, I don't want to oversimplify here. For, for one thing we should keep in mind that there are always going to be individual differences. You know, different people are different and whenever you hear the results of any psychology study put in this form condition a leads people to exhibit behavior x and condition b leads them to exhibit behavior y. Well that is an over simplification. We're always talking about a statistical generalization, it isn't the case that every one who saw the scary movie went for the ad pitch

by客观的观察者，但是看过恐怖电影的人，判断那些脸是威胁和愤怒。正是我们知觉区域，改变了，当模块改变。现在，在这里我不想过度简化。我们应该记住的一件事情是，总是有个体差异。你知道，不同的人是不同的，无论何时你听说任何心理学研究，在这个形式condition a leads 人们 to exhibit行为x和条件b，把他们导向exhibit行为y。好吧，那是一个过度简化。我们总是谈论一个统计概括，它不是这种情况：每个看了那个恐怖电影的人都went for the ad pitch，每年超过一百万人访问的ad。

17:55
visited by over a million people each year. You know, different peoples modules will be activitated By somewhat different things and also will play out somewhat differently in the effects that they have. There's another sense in which I want to be careful not to over simplify and that is just that as these models get fleshed out. There are a lot of subtleties and wrinkles and paradoxes that are going to, to have to be ironed out. I mean, for example. in, in the model we've been describing. in, in the book that, Doug Kenrick co-authored. They have these seven modules. And one of them is the status module.

你知道，不通的人们模块将会被某种不同的东西激活，也将play out某种不同的，对他们的影响。有另一种意义，在我想要小心的不要过度简化，那是that as 这些模块被充实。有许多subtleties和wrinkles和悖论，将会不得不ironed out。我是指，例如，在我们一直在描述的模型里，在那本Doug Kenrick合著的书里，他们有着七个模块。其中之一是状态模块。

And you know when you think of it, the status module is probably going to be activated in the context of other modules. In other words, if you're in mate attraction mode you may well do some kind of status display. For that matter when you're in affiliation mode. And you're trying impress people so that they'll become your friends or whatever. You may engage in a status display, so you have to ask well, what's going on here? We rapidly vacillating back and forth between two modules? Or is it the case that one of these seven main modules can become, in effect a sub module of another of the main modules or what? These are some of the questions. That will have to be addressed. Also it is the case that, that when a module does have a kind of a sub module that it employs as a, as a tool.

你知道当你思考它，状态模块，很可能被激活，在其他模块的背景下。换句话说，如果你在配偶吸引模式，你很可能会做某种状态显示。因为那个原因，当你在从属关系模式时，你就试着给人留下印象，所以他们将会变成你的朋友或者什么的。你可能进入一个状态显示，所以你不得不问，好吧，这里在发生什么？我们很快来回摇摆在两个模块之间？还是这种情况，这其中主要模块之一能够变得，实际上，另一个主模块的一个子模块或者什么？这是其中一些问题。那将不得不被强调。同样它是这种情况，当一个模块有一类作为工具使用的子模块时，

vacillating：犹豫不定;踌躇;拿不定主意
in effect ：实际上

19:27
The effects can be kind of paradoxical in the, in this sense. You know, you might think that the affiliation module being all about friendship. Would involve you know, patting people on their backs, saying nice things to them. Cementing your friendships but an evolutionary psychologist might argue that actually one of the tools employed in the process of regulating a friendship is, is anger, the emotion of anger or you might say the, the module. That anger entails, and this, this subject came up recently in a conversation I had with Leda Cosmides. She was a pioneering figure in the early days of evolutionary psychology and she is as responsible as anyone I would say, for convincing people in evolutionary psychology. That a modular view of the mind really made sense from an evolutionary point of view. And here's how, how this part of the conversation went.

效果将会自相矛盾，在这个意义上。你知道，你可能想，从属关系模块都是关于友谊的。将涉及，你知道，赞许人们在他们背后，对他们说好听的话。巩固你的友谊，但是一个进化心理学家可能主张，实际上这些工具中的一种，雇用了，在常规化一个友谊的过程中，是愤怒，愤怒的情绪，或者你可能说，模块。愤怒势必带来，这个主题最近出现在我和Leda Cosmides的谈话中。她是一个先锋人物，在进化心理学早期，她像任何人一样负责，我将说，对于让人们确信在进化心理学。那个大脑的模块化观点，真的说得通，从进化的观点。下面是谈话怎样进行的。

paradoxical：自相矛盾的；似矛盾而（可能） 正确的
patting：赞许，表扬
Cementing：巩固，加强
entail：使…必然发生;势必造成；使…成为必需

20:32
·>> We've been doing research with Aaron Sell about this and coming out of a period that anger is triggered when somebody does something that makes you realize that they're putting much, much too little weight on your welfare than you think you're entitled to. As a function of the kind of relationship you have with the person. But when that is triggered, when the anger towards that person is triggered, certain things should happen. Because if anger is a system that's designed for interpersonal bargaining, for trying to get the other person to put more weight on your welfare in the future, then

·>>我们一直在做研究，跟Aaron Sell，关于这个，出现了一个时期，愤怒被触发，当某人做了某事，让你意识到他们在放很多重量在你的幸福上，比你想象你能给予的权利的。作为你跟那个人关系的一个功能。但是，当那被触发时，当对那个人的愤怒被触发时，某种事情应该发生。因为如果愤怒是一个系统，被设计来作为人际讨价还价的，作为试着得到在未来另外一个人来放更多重量到你的幸福上，

welfare：健康;安宁;幸福
entitled：给予…权利;给予…资格

21:01
you should have certain motivations to communicate certain things to the person. Like. You imposed a really big cost on me. You may not think you did but you did. And you did it for a small benefit to yourself. How could you do that? I've been a very good cooperator with you, I've been a good friend to you. I've done a lot of things for you in the past. Which is expression of, you know, that I deserve to be treated better than you were treating me. >> Now, to further complicate things, when you think about it a friendship isn't the only context in which the anger module might be deployed.

然后你应该有某种动机去跟那个人交流某种事情，像，你强加一个真的大的代价在我身上。你可能想不这样做，可是你做了。你这样做，为了对你自己的一点点好处。你怎么能那样做呢？我一直是你非常好的合作者，我一直是你的好朋友。我过去为你做了很多事情。那是表达，你知道，我应该得到更好的对待，比你现在对待我的情况。>> 现在，对于更复杂的事情，当你思考它，一个友谊，不是仅有的背景，在愤怒模块可能被有效利用的背景。

imposed：强加
context：(想法、事件等的)背景，环境
deployed：部署，调集（部队或军事力量）；有效利用

21:37
People get angry at, at their mates, at their romantic partners and that kind of makes sense. If indeed the, the terms of a relationship might be re-negotiated from time to time. So it, it, it would be mistaken to think of, of what can recalls the main retention modules being all about buying roses and giving foot massages and stuff like that. In fact there's another example of that, which is jealousy, you know. From an evolutionary psychologist point of view jealousy is a functional thing that, that comes into play and Leda Cosmedis talked with me about that as well.

人们愤怒，对他们的配偶，对他们的恋人，那说得通。如果实际上，关系的术语，可能一次又一次的重复谈判。所以它将是一个错误，去想，什么能召回主要的保留模块，全部关于买玫瑰，足底按摩，和像那样的事情。实际上，有另一种例子，是妒忌。你知道。从进化心理学家的观点，妒忌是一个功能性的东西，它也发挥作用，Leda Cosmedis和我也谈论妒忌。

retention：保留，保持
comes into play：进场，发挥作用，开始活动

·>> We've evolved super ordinate programs that solve the problem of shutting down certain mechanisms and activating other mechanisms in ways that are very well coordinated for solving. A particular adaptive problem. And sure, you can think of sexual jealously that way. I mean the ideas that would shift your attention. You're suddenly going to be paying attention to things like simultaneous absence. You know, if your spouse and the person you suspect are. Both not here at the same time. That's going to [LAUGH], seem. Know, usually we don't notice simultaneous absence. >> Right, right. >> Most people in the world are absent right now.

我们已经进化了超级协调程序，解决通过非常协调的方式关闭某种机制和激活其他机制的问题。一个特别的适应的问题。当然，你能用那个方式思考性妒忌。我是指，那些观点，将会转移你的注意力。你突然关注那些像同步缺失的东西。你知道，如果你的配偶，你怀疑的那个人是。两者都不同时在这里。那将会，看起来，通常我们不会注意同步缺失。>> 对，对。>> 这个世界上的大多数人都缺席现在。

simultaneous：同时发生的;同时出现的;同步的

22:48
I, I don't [LAUGH], I don't notice, I just. It's going to focus your attention in different ways, you're going to have episodic memories, you're going to retrieve episodes from the past where, huh, if you're a man, huh, she got really, dressed up at that, for that party, and she usually doesn't do that, but he was going to be there. What's, you know. You start reevaluating past episodes, so there's memory retrievable functions that are changing, inferences are changing about what people's behavior means. It might be goals that are activated for mate guarding, for keeping track of where your spouse is and what they're doing and who they're talking to.

我没有注意到，我只是。它将通过不同的方式集中你的注意力。你将有松散的记忆，你将检索 episodes从过去，如果你是一个男人，她真的盛装出现那个聚会，她通常不那样做，但是他将也在那里。你知道，你开始重新评估过去的事件，有记忆提取功能，功能在变化，干涉在变化，关于人们的行为意味着什么。目标可能是被配偶保护（模块）激活，为跟踪你的配偶在哪里，他们在做什么，他们在跟谁说话。

episodic：不定期发生的;偶尔发生的；（写作或电影）有许多片段的，不连贯的
retrieve：检索
episodes：插曲;事件;时期

23:26
And it's very hard to, to shut that off. It's very hard if you have to study for a calculus test to do that when your whole sexual jealousy system is activated. By, I would say, by design. That doesn't mean that you're not thinking or not processing information, it's that you're processing information in a particular way. That's well suited for solving that adaptive problem, and part of that emotional state is to deactivate other kinds of adaptive problem, mechanisms that are designed for other kinds of adaptive problems. >> So, in sum, it's all very complex. Any model that's going to be able to do justice to the human mind, which is, after all a very complex thing is, is bound to. Ultimately have to accommodate a lot of complexity and I think that's what we'll see as these models evolve.

那非常难关掉。非常难，如果你不得不研究，为一个微积分测试去做那个，当你整个的性妒忌系统被激活时。我将会说，被设计激活。那不意味着你不是在思考，或者不是在处理信息，那是你在用一个特别的方法处理信息。那是很好的适合于解决那个适应的问题，那情绪状态的部分是免掉激活其他种类的适应性问题，为其他种类的适应性问题而设计的机制。>> 所以，总之，都很复杂。任何模型，将能够对人类大脑公正，毕竟是一个非常复杂的事情，被绑定到。最终，不得不适应很多复杂性，我想那是我们将要看到的随着这些模型进化的东西。

calculus：微积分
evolve：进化

24:15
But the main thing to keep in mind and this applies regardless of whether you buy the module language per se. Or whether you'd rather talk about these things as systems or modes. Or even in some cases just moods and, and emotions. The main thing is that what we're seeing is that very significant changes in our state of mind, our behavioral disposition, can be ushered in without our consciously choosing to change our state of mind. Now we've long known this about things like jealousy and anger you know, it's kind of obvious that these things just kind of seem to seize control sometimes.

但是要记住的主要事情，这个应用无关你是否买那个模块语言本身。或者你是否宁愿作为系统或者模式来谈论这些东西。或者甚至在一些例子里只是心境和情绪。主要的事情是，我们看到的东西，是非常重要的改变，在我们的大脑状态，我们的行为倾向，能够被开启，没有我们的意识选择去改变我们大脑的状态。现在我们很早就知道这个，关于像妒忌和愤怒的事情，你知道，它很显然，这些东西只是看起来有时候抓住了控制权。

per se：本身，本质上
state：状况;状态;情况

But I think we're going to become more and more aware of what subtle changes can be ushered in without our actually choosing them. So for example when, when the people came out of that movie, the people who had seen the romantic movie and then chose one of the two ad pitches, it's a pretty subtle change of mind but I don't think they, they conscientiously chose to flip the switch on some new module. And probably weren't aware in fact that a change in disposition had actually happened. So it, it's looking very much like the kind of conscious mind isn't very often choosing what frame of mind we're in. And this too came up in my conversation with Leda Cosmides. You don't choose the module, the module chooses you almost, you know?

但是我认为我们将要变得越来越意识到什么微妙的改变能被开启，我们没有实际选择它们。例如，当人们从那个电影里出来时，人们看了爱情电影的选择了两个广告宣传中的一个，它是相当微妙的思维的改变，但是我不认为他们有意识地选择去打开开关，在一些新模块上。很可能没有觉察到事实上，一个改变，在倾向上已经实际上发生了。它看起来非常像有意识地思维不是经常选择我们在的那个思维框架里。这在我和Leda Cosmides的谈话中出现了。你不选择这个模块，模块总是选择你，你知道吗？

flip：迅速打开(或关掉)(装置);按(开关)；突然心烦意乱;勃然大怒
disposition：性情;性格；倾向;意向；排列;布置

·>> Right, right. Except that, what is the you anyway? >> Now, when Leda expresses skepticism about the idea of a you, she's speaking from a kind of evolutionary point of view. Because from that point of view, it's not obvious why the mind would consist of anything other than modules, right? Because if you ask, well how did we get from being one celled creatures, which our distant ancestors were, to being human beings, the answer is we evolved. And we evolved nervous systems, and in particular we involved a part of the nervous system known as the brain, and the brain evolved in increments. In bits and pieces and chunks, but according to the theory of natural selection, every significant chunk, every increment you know, evolved for a, a reason.

·>> 对，对。除了那个，究竟什么是你？>> 现在当Leda表示了怀疑，对你的观点，她在说，从进化的观点。因为从那个观点，并不明显，为什么思维将由任何东西而不是模块组成，对吗？因为如果你问，好吧我们怎么从作为一个单细胞生物，我们遥远的祖先，变成人类，答案是我们进化。我们进化了神经系统，特别是我们包括了被称为大脑的神经系统，大脑在增长额上进化了。一点一滴一块，但是根据自然选择的理论，每个重要的组块，每个增长额你知道的，都是因为一个原因进化的。

26:36
Generically the reason is that it helped us get genes into the next generation but there was a more specific reason as well.

通常来讲原因是它帮助我们将基因传递到下一代，但是也有一个更具体的原因。

26:44
You know, the, the idea is, is that this part of the brain would help us attract mates better than the average member of our species or help us take care of our offspring better than the average member of our species or help us make friends or protect ourselves or whatever. And, from an evolutionary point of view, you know, that's what the whole evolution of mind consists of. The accumulation of these functional. Units. These things you can call modules. And it's not obvious why at any point, something that you would call a you would, would suddenly show up. Something that you would call a, a self, as it's commonly conceived.

你知道，观点是，大脑的这部分将帮助我们更加吸引配偶，比我们种类的其他普通成员，或者帮助我们更好的照顾后代，比我们种群的普通成员，或者帮助我们交朋友或者保护自己或者其他什么。从进化观点看，你知道的，那是构成整个思维进化的东西。这些功能的累积。单元。这些东西你能称为模块。它不明显，为什么在任意点上，有些你将称为一个你的东西，将突然出现。有些你将称为一个自我的东西，像它通常被认为的那样。

27:22
In any event. With Leda's skepticism about the you, you know we are, we are getting back to the Buddha who of course had a similar skepticism. More specifically if you remember his discourse on the not self there were two themes in particular that he emphasized. First of all. He seemed not to see how you could claim that there is some kind of coherent self that persists through time. There seemed to him to be too much flux too much impermanence. And a modular view of the mind helps explain why that would be because there is no single coherent self. There are a number of, of. What you could call sub cells or modules or whatever that kind of take turns running the show.

无论如何，Leda对于你的怀疑，你知道，我们将回到佛陀，当然他有相似的怀疑。更具体地，如果你记住他的布道，在非我上的，有两个主题，他特别强调的。首先，他看起来没有看到你怎么声明有某种连贯的自我，随着时间持续。对他，看起来有太多的变动太多无常。思维的模块化观点帮助解释那是为什么，因为没有单个连贯的自我。有许多，你可以称为子单元或者模块或者任何什么那种主持节目的东西。

coherent：一致的;连贯的
flux：变动，波动

The other big theme in that discourse was the Buddha saying, look if you think you have, you know conscious control, or very much, of what's going on in your mind, you know I think you're wrong. And the modular view helps explain why that would be the case, as well. Because our state of mind at any given time is not, generally speaking, the result of conscious choice. But rather, it's the result of how the information in our environment. Comes into our minds and, and at a, at a typically unconscious level. Shifts our frame of mind. Okay, so this very important part of Buddha's doctrine makes a lot of sense, in, in, the context of the modular view of the mind.

另一个大主题，那个布道里的，是佛陀说，看，如果你想，你有，你知道，有意识的控制，或者控制你大脑中进行的东西，你知道，我认为你是错的。模块化观点帮助解释为什么是那种情况，同样。因为我们大脑的状态，在任意特定时间，不是，通常来说，不是有意识选择的结果。但是更确切地说，它是在我们环境里的信息怎样的结果。好吧，这个佛陀教义中非常重要的部分，很有意义，在思维的模块化观点的背景下。

rahter：而是；更确切地说；还不如说；相反

29:03
And in the next lecture, what we're going to talk about. Is how the the modular view of the mind helps makes sense of Buddha's practice. In particular meditation and more specifically mindfulness meditation, we're going to ask whether a modular view of the mind helps explain what's going on in the course of mindfulness meditation, and why it works the way it does We're also going to continue to flesh out the modular view of the mind. For example, we're going to ask, is it the case that there can be conflicts between two modules, if they're both kind of strongly activated? And might this explain why we sometimes have issues of self-control, have trouble controlling the appetite?

在下一堂课，我们将要谈论的是，思维的模块化观点，将怎样帮助让佛陀的修行说得通。特别是冥修和更多具体的正念冥修。我们将要问，是否思维的模块化观点帮助解释，正念冥想过程中发生了什么，为什么它以它那样的方式起作用，我们也会继续充实思维的模块化观点。例如，我们将要问，是这种情况吗，可能会有两个模块产生冲突，如果他们同样被强烈地激活？这可能解释，为什么我们有时候在自我控制上有问题，在控制欲望上有麻烦？

appetite：胃口;食欲；强烈欲望;渴望

29:46
and, if so, what rules if any, ultimately determine which module wins. And we're going to ask whether mindfulness meditation can actually change the rules about which module wins. So in the next lecture we're going to talk about the modular view of the mind and mindfulness meditation.

如果这样，什么规则，如果任何最终决定，哪个模块会赢。我们将要问，是否正念冥想能够真的改变规则，关于哪个模块赢的。所以在下堂课，我们将要谈论思维的模块化观点和正念冥想。
