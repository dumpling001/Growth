So in the previous segment of this lecture we talked about mental modules. I said they're different kinds of modules, and I said that there's a particular kind of module that we're looking for. We're looking for modules that aren't just tools, like the blades in a Swiss Army Knife, but are in a sense command modules. That is they can, they can take control of the mind for at least a while. Because if there are such modules, that would help explain how the mind could operate effectively without there being a single unified self in control. The idea is that there might be a number of these command modules and they would kind of take turns running the show. Well, I've got good news. I have found such modules, or at least I've found somebody who says that he has found such modules. His name is Douglas Kenrick. He's a psychologist at Arizona State University and in 2013 he co-authored a book called, The Rational Animal, which puts forth a modular view of the mind, a modular model. And the book argues that when it comes to our social behavior, we're pretty much always under the influence.


在本堂课上一小节我们谈论了精神模块。我说它们是不同类型的模块，我说有一个特别的模块，我们正在找。我们在找不仅仅是工具的模块，像瑞士军刀上的刀片，但在某个意义上是命令模块。就是它们能控制大脑至少一小会儿。因为如果有这种模块，那将帮助解释，大脑如何有效运作，在没有有控制力的单个统一的自我的情况下。观点是，这里可能有很多控制模块，它们将会轮流主持节目。好吧，我有好消息，我找到了这些模块，至少我发现有人说，他发现了这样的模块。他的名字是Douglas Kenrick。他是一个心理学家，在Arizona州立大学，在2013年，他合著了一本书叫做，理性动物。那本书put forth一个大脑的模块化观点，一个模块化模型。这本书主张，当谈及到我们的社交行为，我们相当总是在影响之下。

Of one of seven modules that, Kendrick and his co-author call sub-selves. Now, sub self is an interesting term. The prefix, sub, of course, means under. So this might suggest that there is one unified self at the top. Of the hierarchy. And it determines which of the seven modules or subcells is in charge at any given time. It delegates authority. Well, it turns out that, actually, that's not what Kenrick meant to convey by the term as became evident in an exchange I had with him recently.

在七个模块之一，Kendrick和他的合著者称为sub-selves.现在子我是一个有趣的术语。前缀，sub，当然，意思是在什么之下。所以这可能暗示，有一个统一的自我在上面。在层级结构的上面。它决定了，七个模块的拿一个，或者subcells在任何给定的时间里起控制作用。它delegates权威。好吧，结果是，实际上，它不是Kenrick意图传递的，通过这个术语传递的，as变得明显，在一次我跟他最近的交流中。

·>> With these sub cells or modules, I might view these sub cells as almost kind of mega modules or mega modules because they mobilize a lot of smaller modules.

这些子cells或者模块，我可以把这些sub cells看作几乎是mega模块，或者mega模块，因为它们调动了很多更小的模块。

·>> They're higher level modules, but I'd say that's as high as it gets. There isn't another one at the top. There isn't another kind of decision, there isn't like a president in charge of all this.

它们是高层次的模块，但是我要说，它已经到了最高点。在上面没有其他模块。没有另一种类型的决定，没有像总统一样掌控全部的东西。

·>> Right.

对的。

·>> All there are, are there's you know, a Secretary of State and a Secretary of Warfare and you know.

有，你知道，州秘书，和战争秘书，你知道。

·>> Right.

对的。

·>> And then a Secretary of you know, Mayday.

然后，一个Mayday的秘书。

·>> Okay, so Kenrick says these modules are like cabinet secretaries. That raises at least three questions. First of all, what are the seven cabinet positions? What domains. Are these modules in charge of. Second, what determines, if there is no president, what determines which module is in charge at a given time and third what difference does it make which module is in charge? What exactly are the changes in behavioral and mental disposition that different modules. Usher in. Well as far as the question goes, you know, what are the seven Cabinet positions. Kenrick is an evolutionary

好的，所以Kenrick说，这些模块像cabinet秘书。这引发了至少三个问题。首先，七个cabinet位置是什么？什么区域？这些模块主控吗？第二，什么决定，如果没有总统，什么决定了哪个模块掌控，在某个时间点上。第三，哪个模块掌控有什么差别？确切的是在行为和精神上disposition 不同模块的改变。Usher in。至今问题继续，你知道，什么是七个cabinet位置。Kenrick是一个进化心理学家，

psychologist, so he approaches his question from an evolutionary point of view. And he says, well basically in the realm of social behavior, there are seven main kinds of challenges in his view. That our ancestors had to meet in order to get their genes into the next generation. So you would expect natural selection to build a mind that attends to these seven areas of challenge. And that's how he comes up with his list of seven modules. First, there's a self protection module, which, indeed, would be a valuable thing from natural selection's point of view. In other words. The ability to fend off harm if other members of our species want to harm us.

所以他approaches他的问题，从一个进化的观点。所以他说，基本上，在社交行为的realm，在他的观点里有七种主要类型的挑战。我们的祖先必须见面，为了让他们的基因传到下一代。所以你将期待自然选择建立一个大脑，倾向于这七个挑战区域的大脑。那是他怎样提出他的七模型列表的。首先，这是自我保护模块，实际上，从自然选择的观点看将是一个有价值的东西。换句话说，fend off伤害的能力，如果我们种群的其他成员想要伤害我们。


3:28
second, if the object of the game is get genes into the next generation, it would help to be able to attract mates. It would also help to be able to hold onto mates, and then there is what Kenrick and his coauthor called the affiliation. Module that has to do with making friendships and making alliances and so on. There's the kin care module, in other words taking care of other people who share a lot of your genes. That makes sense in terms of. Natural selection. There's a status module. Certainly people do seem inclined to seek status and to display status. And that does seem to be correlated with getting genes into the next generation during evolution. And then there's a kind of anomalous module.

第二，如果游戏的目的是让基因传到下一代，它将帮助能够吸引配偶。它也帮助能hold onto配偶，然后有Kenrick和他的合著者称为affiliation的东西。模块，与交朋友和alliances等等相关。根据自然选择它说得通。有一个状态模块。当然人们确实看起来倾向于谋取地位并展示地位。在进化过程中，那确实看起来与“把基因传递到下一代”相关。然后有一种anomalous模块。

4:15
The disease avoidance module which just means, you know, basically staying away from people who seem to carry germs. Now, I want to emphasize, this is just one possible module or view of the mind. It's not a consensus view among people who take a module or view of the mind. But it does make sense as a basic division of mental labor and it certainly gives us something to get a handle on in terms of just thinking about these modular models of the mind. Now we can look at specific proposed modules, ask how

疾病避免模块，只是指，你知道，基本远离看起来携带germs的人们。现在，我想要强调，这只是一个可能的模块，或者对思维的看法。它不是那些有思维模块化观点的人们看法一致的观点（华佼注：我认为应该没有“or”）。但是它确实说得通，作为一个基本的精神labor的分类，它当然给我们一些东西，去控制，根据只是思考这些思维模块化的模块。现在我们能看具体的proposed模块，

they would work and see how valuable this kind of model actually is. So let's focus on the first two modules, self protection and mate attraction, and let's ask the second and third of those three questions I just outlined, okay. Second question is what is it that determines which module will be in charge at any given time. And here I think Kenrick's answer is pretty much the answer that you'd get from a lot of people who subscribe to a modular view of the mind. The basic idea is, that which ever module is most highly activated by information in the environment, will tend to become dominant for some period of time. So one example is.

问它们将怎样工作，看这种模型实际上怎样有价值。所以让我们关注前面两个模块，自我保护，和配偶吸引。让我们问我刚刚列出的那三个问题中的第二个，第三个。第二个问题是，它是什么，决定，哪个模块将在某个给定的时间主控。我想Kenrick的答案刚好就是那个答案，就是你将从许多人那里得到的，那些人subscribe to大脑的模块化观点。**基本的观点是，哪种ever模块，是最高度地被环境中的信息激活，将倾向于变得地位显著，对那个特定的时间段。** （华佼注：完全同意这个观点。我的一种模糊的直觉在这里被表述的非常清楚。）这是一个例子。

5:33
If somebody is running toward you waving a machete saying I'm going to kill you, then that would, you know, the self protection module would kick in and you might start running away and screaming help, help help. That's a pretty straight forward example of a module becoming highly active and then dominate and kind of controlling your behavior. In fact, it's such a straightforward example that you might ask, wait a second, do we really need all this fancy module talk? I mean I've, I've always known that fear makes people do things like run away. How much value is really added when we, when we call this thing a module? Well, it's a good question, but I would ask you, just reserve judgement and see how far we can go with these, with this model and see what it looks like after we flesh it out.

如果某人朝你跑过来，你挥着一个machete说，我要杀了你，然后那将，你知道，自我保护模块将会kick in，你可能开始逃跑，喊叫救命，救命，救命。那是模块的一个相当直接forward例子，变得高度活跃，然后主导，有点儿控制你的行为。实际上，它是如此直白的一个例子，你可能会问，等一下，我们真的需要所有这些fancy模块talk吗？我是指，我一直知道，恐惧让人们做像逃跑那样的事。多少价值真的被增加了，当我们，当我们称这些东西是一个模块？好吧，这恶是个好问题。但是我将要问题你，只是reserve判断，看看我们能走多远，带着这个模块，看看它看起来像什么，在我们充实它之后。

A little more. For now, let's move onto the third of the three questions. What difference does it make which module is in charge? How does a module change our behavioral and mental disposition? And here I think what's interesting is how subtle some of the changes can be. And this came through in an experiment that Kenrick did along with a number of. Collaborators one thing they were looking at in this experiment. Is how do people respond to advertising. They created an ad for a meuseum. And they created two different versions of the ad with two different tag lines. One of the tag lines was visited by over a million people each year.

再多一点。对于现在，让我们移到三个问题中的第三个。它有什么区别，哪个模块主控？一个模块怎么改变我们的行为和精神的disposition？我想有趣的是，有些改变可以是怎样的微妙。这个来自与一个实验，Kenrick做的，并伴随着许多合作者。一件事他们观察的，在这个实验里。是人们怎样对广告做反应。他们创造了一个博物馆的广告，他们创造了两个带着不同tag线的不同版本的广告。tag lines的一个，被访问，被一百万以上的人们，每年。

And the other tag line was, stand out from the crowd. Now those are two very different angles that you would think might appeal to different kinds of people. But one question that Kenrick and his collaborators, and his collaborators were interested in was, well, could you change which ad pitch will appeal to a given person by changing which module is in charge at that moment. So they came up with a way of activating either the self protection module or the mate attraction module. They showed people scenes from one of two movies, either a scary movie, The Shining with Jack Nicholson or a romantic movie called Before Sunrise.

另一个tag线是，stand out从人群中。现在那些是两个非常不同的角度，你将认为可能吸引到两种不同类型的人。但是一个问题Kenrick和他的合作者们，他的合作者们，感兴趣的是，好吧，你能改变，哪个广告pitch将会吸引到一个特定的人，通过改变当时正在主控的模块吗？所以他们提出一个方法，激活或者自我保护模块，或者配偶吸引模块。他们给人们展示景色，从两个电影中的一个，或者是恐怖电影，The Shining with Jack Nicholson或者一个浪漫电影，叫做太阳升起之前。

7:37
Then after the people had seen parts of one of these two movies, then they saw the ad. And then they were asked questions like, well how inclined would you be to visit this museum? And it turned out that people who had seen the scary movie, were more inclined to visit the museum when they saw the tag line, visited by over a million people each year. Perhaps because you know, there is safety in numbers so if your fear module is activated, if Jack Nichols is chasing you with an ax, you'd rather be around a lot of people who might be able to help. But in an event, that was the finding. And it turned out that seeing the romantic movie inclined people to go for the tagline stand out from the crowd, which could be because when we're in courtship mode, we're trying to distinguish ourselves from other people.

在人们看到了这两个电影中一个的部分之后，然后他们看那个广告。然后他们被问问题，像你将有多有倾向去参观这个博物馆？结果发现看过恐怖电影的人，更愿意去参观，当他们看到tag line，每年有超过一百万人参观的。也许因为你知道，在数字里有安全感。所以如果你害怕模块被激活，如果Jack Nichols在追逐你，带着一个斧头，你将宁愿在很多可能会帮助你的人们中间。但是在一个情况下，那是发现。结果发现，看浪漫电影的人，让人们倾向于去一个tagline stand out从人群中，那可能是因为，当我们在courtship模式时，我们试着让我们与其他人有所区别。

Could also be because when we're in courtship mode, in mate attraction mode, we are looking for an intimate environment to be alone with the person. But in any event, what's interesting here is that here's something that you might think is a more or less fixed part of a person's personality. In other words, they're going to go for one tag line or the other. There's two kinds of people. And I imagine that's the way advertisers might think of it, that these two ads would appeal to two different kinds of people. But no, it turns out that actually it, each, each ad can appeal to one person it just depends on which you, you are at the moment. It depends on which module is in charge at the moment.

也可能因为当我们在courtship模式时，在配偶吸引模式，我们在找一个亲密的环境，和那个人在一起。但是在任何情况下，有趣的是，有些东西你可能认为是或多或少是一个人个性的固定部分。换句话说，他们将去，因为一个tag line或者另一个。有两种人。我想象，那是广告商可能认为的那样，这两个广告将要吸引到两种不同类型的人。但是，不，结果发现，实际上，每个广告能吸引到同一个人，只是取悦于那个时刻是哪个你。它取悦于那个时刻哪个模块是主控的。

9:12
Now there was another experiment that, that looked at a very similar idea. In other words, it looked at something we might expect to remain pretty constant and then, and then it examined how you might actually make it, make it change.

现在有另一个实验，看一个相似的观点。换句话说，它看有些东西我们可能期望去保留相当常量，然后它检查你实际上可能怎样让它改变的。

9:28
And this is this involves something that economists call a time discounting rate or future discounting rate or in even more technical terms. An inter-temporal utility function. What this refers to is your willingness to forgo reward in a short term for a greater reward in the future. So if I say to you, look, you can either have $10 today or you can have $15 in a month, which do you want? How you answer this question, and other questions like that, determines what your time discount rate is. And economists have long said that, you know, people will, different people have different such rates.

这是这个，包括了有些东西，被经济学家称为一个时间discounting率，或者将来discounting率，或者甚至更多技术术语。一个inter-temporal utility功能。这个指的是，你的意愿，去forgo奖励，在短期，为一个更大的奖励，在将来的。所以如果我对你说，看，你能或者有10美元今天，或者你能有15美元一个月以后，你要哪种？你怎么回答这个问题，和另一个像这样的问题，决定了你的时间discount率是什么。经济学家一直说，你知道，人们，不同的人们有不同的这种比率。

But the models of economists have tended to assume that any given person's time discount rate would remain a constant. You know, from day to day and week to week. Well, it turns out not to be the case, and one way we know is because of an experiment that was done by Margo Wilson who was a very important figure in evolutionary psychology and passed away a few years ago. And she did the experiment along with her long time collaborator Martin Daly. And what they did is, they took men and they showed some of them pictures of women who had been judged as attractive on one of these websites where people go and judge men and women as either hot or not hot.

但是经济学家的模型，倾向于假设，任何特定的人的时间discount率将保持为一个常量。你知道，一天有一天，一周又一周。好吧，结果发现不是那样的。我们知道的一个方法是，因为一个实验，被Margo Wilson做的，他是一个非常重要的人物，在进化心理学上，几年前去世了。她做了这个实验，和她的长期合作者Martin Daly。他们做的是，他们选择男人们，他们给这些男人们的一些人显示女人的图片，那个女人被认为是有吸引力的，在这些网站上，人们去判断男人和女人，是hot还是不hot。

10:53
And they showed other men pictures of other things, either women who hadn't been judged as attractive or pictures of men or pictures of cars. Or whatever. And it turned out that, when men had seen these pictures of attractive women, they were then more inclined than they otherwise would have been to, want their money now. To not be willing to forego immediate, reward for a greater reward in the future. And the, kind of, common-sensical evolutionary explanation of this is that, you know, when the mate attraction module is activated, when you're in courtship mode, you want to put on a display, you want to have all your resources there to show off in front of the woman.

他们显示其他男人的图片，在其他东西中。或者没有被判定为有吸引力的女人，或者男人的图片，或者车的图片。或者其他什么。结果发现，当男人看过了这些有吸引力的女人图片后，他们就更倾向于比他们原本更想要他们的钱了现在。不愿意forego立刻，奖励为更大的奖励在将来的。对这个有点基本sensical进化的解释是，你知道，当配偶吸引模式被激活时，当你在求偶模式，你想要put on一个display，你想要有你那里所有的资源，去在女人面前炫耀。

11:37
Now this you know, if this is the strategy it doesn't seem to be orchestrated at a conscious level because remember they're just looking at pictures of attractive women. And, and there's no way they'd think consciously I'd certainly like to impress this picture of a woman whom I will never actually meet.

现在你知道，如果这是策略，它看起来不orchestrated，在一个有意识的层次上。因为记住，他们只是看了有吸引力的女人的照片。他们可能有意识的想，我当然想要给照片上那个我实际绝不会遇到的女人留下印象。

11:55
That doesn't make any sense, right?

那说不通，对吗？

11:58
And the fact that the mere picture of a woman does trigger this kind of strategic response reminds us that we were designed by natural selection for an environment that's different from the current environment. In other words, it was an environment in this case. Before the invention of photography. So during evolution if you ever saw a, an, an image of a woman, there was a real woman there. So our, our, our minds are designed to, in some ways at least respond to images of, all images of women as if they were real women. Now there was another experiment Where a feature that you might think is a pretty more or less constant property of a person's mind turned out to change in response to the activation of the mate attraction module. In this experiment psychologists took high school males. And they had them fill out a survey about their career aspirations. Some of them filled it out in a room full of other males. Some of them filled it out in a room that included both males filling it out and some females filling it out. And it turned out that the, the boys in the room that included girls their age were more inclined to have. More ambitious career aspirs, aspirations and in particular to, to rate income, making a lot of money as an important goal associated with their aspirations. Now, I doubt that this was some kind of enduring change in their actual aspirations. It could well be that what was happening was that their minds were being prepared for a kind of self advertisement, a kind of display. In other words, in the event that they wound up talking to the females in the room, they would be all prepared to talk about how they were going to conquer the world and make lots of. Money and so on. But if that indeed was the strategy, it, it, it, doesn't seem to have been a conscious strategy, because after all, the surveys they were filling out, the girls weren't going to see, and the girls couldn't see the surveys from where they were.



14:05
And moreover, these, these the people in the experiment had been told not to talk to one another, so there wasn't even a prospect of talking. To the girls in the short run. So again this is a case where this doesn't seem to involve conscious orchestration of a kind of strategy. There's no conscious decision to usher in a particular module and yet it happens nonetheless. By the way, in both of these last two experiments, the experiments were performed not only on males, but also on females. But the, the effecting question was not found in the case of the females, and that's in keeping with the view in evolutionary psychology that when it comes to, kind of, romantic psychology, sexual psychology. There will be some differences between, between men and women. You could have just as easily done experiments that would highlight distinctively female features of the mate a, attraction module. Just so happened that these. Focused on male features. Okay, so we've seen three things that you might think would be more or less constant features of a person's personality and wouldn't, wouldn't change a lot. What kind of ad pitch they respond to, what their career aspirations are, and what their timed discounting rate is. In all three cases, there can be significant change in these. Without some kind of conscious self deciding to make the change.



15:38
Now, you might look at this and say, you, you still might ask the question, do we really need all this module talk? Can't we talk about these people just being in say, a romantic mood? Well, I don't think so. I mean I, I, I doubt that the, the people who were taking the survey, the guys who were taking the survey in the presence of the girls were really entering what we normally call a romantic mood and I doubt that was true of the guys who were shown the pictures of. The women. I am of the view that there is probably some change in affect, some change in feeling that is associated with these shifts of module, but I don't think the, the word mood is going to always be appropriate. Another reason that I think the term module makes sense. Is because, you know, we're talking when you add it all up, we're talking about a-a-a kind of diverse array of changes in our very mental orientation, our frame of mind. And that includes our, our perceptual framework because if you remember from the first lecture, we talked about an experiment. In which first psychologists showed people a part of a scary movie, in this case it was Silence Of The Lambs. And then they showed them pictures of males in a different ethnic group, and these were facial expressions that had been judged as neutral. By objective observers but the people who'd seen the scary movie judged the, the faces to be threatening and angrier. So, so our very kind of perceptual field is, is changed when, when modules change. Now, I don't want to oversimplify here. For, for one thing we should keep in mind that there are always going to be individual differences. You know, different people are different and whenever you hear the results of any psychology study put in this form condition a leads people to exhibit behavior x and condition b leads them to exhibit behavior y. Well that is an over simplification. We're always talking about a statistical generalization, it isn't the case that every one who saw the scary movie went for the ad pitch



17:55
visited by over a million people each year. You know, different peoples modules will be activitated By somewhat different things and also will play out somewhat differently in the effects that they have. There's another sense in which I want to be careful not to over simplify and that is just that as these models get fleshed out. There are a lot of subtleties and wrinkles and paradoxes that are going to, to have to be ironed out. I mean, for example. in, in the model we've been describing. in, in the book that, Doug Kenrick co-authored. They have these seven modules. And one of them is the status module. And you know when you think of it, the status module is probably going to be activated in the context of other modules. In other words, if you're in mate attraction mode you may well do some kind of status display. For that matter when you're in affiliation mode. And you're trying impress people so that they'll become your friends or whatever. You may engage in a status display, so you have to ask well, what's going on here? We rapidly vacillating back and forth between two modules? Or is it the case that one of these seven main modules can become, in effect a sub module of another of the main modules or what? These are some of the questions. That will have to be addressed. Also it is the case that, that when a module does have a kind of a sub module that it employs as a, as a tool.



19:27
The effects can be kind of paradoxical in the, in this sense. You know, you might think that the affiliation module being all about friendship. Would involve you know, patting people on their backs, saying nice things to them. Cementing your friendships but an evolutionary psychologist might argue that actually one of the tools employed in the process of regulating a friendship is, is anger, the emotion of anger or you might say the, the module. That anger entails, and this, this subject came up recently in a conversation I had with Leda Cosmides. She was a pioneering figure in the early days of evolutionary psychology and she is as responsible as anyone I would say, for convincing people in evolutionary psychology. That a modular view of the mind really made sense from an evolutionary point of view. And here's how, how this part of the conversation went. >> We've been doing research with Aaron Sell about this and



20:32
coming out of a period that anger is triggered when somebody does something that makes you realize that they're putting much, much too little weight on your welfare than you think you're entitled to. As a function of the kind of relationship you have with the person. But when that is triggered, when the anger towards that person is triggered, certain things should happen. Because if anger is a system that's designed for interpersonal bargaining, for trying to get the other person to put more weight on your welfare in the future, then



21:01
you should have certain motivations to communicate certain things to the person. Like. You imposed a really big cost on me. You may not think you did but you did. And you did it for a small benefit to yourself. How could you do that? I've been a very good cooperator with you, I've been a good friend to you. I've done a lot of things for you in the past. Which is expression of, you know, that I deserve to be treated better than you were treating me. >> Now, to further complicate things, when you think about it a friendship isn't the only context in which the anger module might be deployed.



21:37
People get angry at, at their mates, at their romantic partners and that kind of makes sense. If indeed the, the terms of a relationship might be re-negotiated from time to time. So it, it, it would be mistaken to think of, of what can recalls the main retention modules being all about buying roses and giving foot massages and stuff like that. In fact there's another example of that, which is jealousy, you know. From an evolutionary psychologist point of view jealousy is a functional thing that, that comes into play and Leda Cosmedis talked with me about that as well. >> We've evolved super ordinate programs that solve the problem of shutting down certain mechanisms and activating other mechanisms in ways that are very well coordinated for solving. A particular adaptive problem. And sure, you can think of sexual jealously that way. I mean the ideas that would shift your attention. You're suddenly going to be paying attention to things like simultaneous absence. You know, if your spouse and the person you suspect are. Both not here at the same time. That's going to [LAUGH], seem. Know, usually we don't notice simultaneous absence. >> Right, right. >> Most people in the world are absent right now.



22:48
I, I don't [LAUGH], I don't notice, I just. It's going to focus your attention in different ways, you're going to have episodic memories, you're going to retrieve episodes from the past where, huh, if you're a man, huh, she got really, dressed up at that, for that party, and she usually doesn't do that, but he was going to be there. What's, you know. You start reevaluating past episodes, so there's memory retrievable functions that are changing, inferences are changing about what people's behavior means. It might be goals that are activated for mate guarding, for keeping track of where your spouse is and what they're doing and who they're talking to.



23:26
And it's very hard to, to shut that off. It's very hard if you have to study for a calculus test to do that when your whole sexual jealousy system is activated. By, I would say, by design. That doesn't mean that you're not thinking or not processing information, it's that you're processing information in a particular way. That's well suited for solving that adaptive problem, and part of that emotional state is to deactivate other kinds of adaptive problem, mechanisms that are designed for other kinds of adaptive problems. >> So, in sum, it's all very complex. Any model that's going to be able to do justice to the human mind, which is, after all a very complex thing is, is bound to. Ultimately have to accommodate a lot of complexity and I think that's what we'll see as these models evolve.



24:15
But the main thing to keep in mind and this applies regardless of whether you buy the module language per se. Or whether you'd rather talk about these things as systems or modes. Or even in some cases just moods and, and emotions. The main thing is that what we're seeing is that very significant changes in our state of mind, our behavioral disposition, can be ushered in without our consciously choosing to change our state of mind. Now we've long known this about things like jealousy and anger you know, it's kind of obvious that these things just kind of seem to seize control sometimes. But I think we're going to become more and more aware of what subtle changes can be ushered in without our actually choosing them. So for example when, when the people came out of that movie, the people who had seen the romantic movie and then chose one of the two ad pitches, it's a pretty subtle change of mind but I don't think they, they conscientiously chose to flip the switch on some new module. And probably weren't aware in fact that a change in disposition had actually happened. So it, it's looking very much like the kind of conscious mind isn't very often choosing what frame of mind we're in. And this too came up in my conversation with Leda Cosmides. You don't choose the module, the module chooses you almost, you know? >> Right, right. Except that, what is the you anyway? >> Now, when Leda expresses skepticism about the idea of a you, she's speaking from a kind of evolutionary point of view. Because from that point of view, it's not obvious why the mind would consist of anything other than modules, right? Because if you ask, well how did we get from being one celled creatures, which our distant ancestors were, to being human beings, the answer is we evolved. And we evolved nervous systems, and in particular we involved a part of the nervous system known as the brain, and the brain evolved in increments. In bits and pieces and chunks, but according to the theory of natural selection, every significant chunk, every increment you know, evolved for a, a reason.



26:36
Generically the reason is that it helped us get genes into the next generation but there was a more specific reason as well.

You know, the, the idea is, is that this part of the brain would help us attract mates better than the average member of our species or help us take care of our offspring better than the average member of our species or help us make friends or protect ourselves or whatever. And, from an evolutionary point of view, you know, that's what the whole evolution of mind consists of. The accumulation of these functional. Units. These things you can call modules. And it's not obvious why at any point, something that you would call a you would, would suddenly show up. Something that you would call a, a self, as it's commonly conceived.



27:22
In any event. With Leda's skepticism about the you, you know we are, we are getting back to the Buddha who of course had a similar skepticism. More specifically if you remember his discourse on the not self there were two themes in particular that he emphasized. First of all. He seemed not to see how you could claim that there is some kind of coherent self that persists through time. There seemed to him to be too much flux too much impermanence. And a modular view of the mind helps explain why that would be because there is no single coherent self. There are a number of, of. What you could call sub cells or modules or whatever that kind of take turns running the show. The other big theme in that discourse was the Buddha saying, look if you think you have, you know conscious control, or very much, of what's going on in your mind, you know I think you're wrong. And the modular view helps explain why that would be the case, as well. Because our state of mind at any given time is not, generally speaking, the result of conscious choice. But rather, it's the result of how the information in our environment. Comes into our minds and, and at a, at a typically unconscious level. Shifts our frame of mind. Okay, so this very important part of Buddha's doctrine makes a lot of sense, in, in, the context of the modular view of the mind.

And in the next lecture, what we're going to talk about. Is how the the modular view of the mind helps makes sense of Buddha's practice. In particular meditation and more specifically mindfulness meditation, we're going to ask whether a modular view of the mind helps explain what's going on in the course of mindfulness meditation, and why it works the way it does We're also going to continue to flesh out the modular view of the mind. For example, we're going to ask, is it the case that there can be conflicts between two modules, if they're both kind of strongly activated? And might this explain why we sometimes have issues of self-control, have trouble controlling the appetite?



29:46
and, if so, what rules if any, ultimately determine which module wins. And we're going to ask whether mindfulness meditation can actually change the rules about which module wins. So in the next lecture we're going to talk about the modular view of the mind and mindfulness meditation.
